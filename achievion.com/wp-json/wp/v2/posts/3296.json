Additionally, they need to move away from a\none-size-fits-all approach onto a user experience that is more personalized;\nthis will help to yield better results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, several challenges need to be overcome to make this\ntransition; the most significant of these challenges is the time and effort\nrequired to make the shift to a more personalized user experience. A lot needs\nto be done by the businesses wanting to make the move including mapping out\nindividual journeys, developing marketing-driven personas, identifying the key\nmoments, and then working around those factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to truly understanding the individual users\nand their needs, marketing-driven personas can often be flawed. This means that\nthe traditional way of personalizing the user experience or customer journey\nwouldn\u2019t get you far. The only way that can truly bridge the gap is by using\nartificial intelligence (AI). Following are two ways AI is aiding the personalization\nprocess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Advancement of Narrow AI<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve had AI for almost three decades now. However, advances\nin AI in the past decade or so have helped to develop cognitive systems with\nthe ability to learn, understand, reason, and interact. For businesses looking\nto enhance their marketing efforts or the customer journey, a relevant area is\nthe advancement of \u201cnarrow AI\u201d. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is narrow AI? It is the application of the general\nalgorithms and concepts of AI to particular, closely-defined problem areas for optimal-value\nresults. In recent years, there has been rapid progress in narrow AI. There was\na need to understand and then code the algorithms only a decade ago. However,\nthis changed about five years ago when AI and ML algorithms started to be\ncommodified and moved to the cloud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was the benefit of this? it has allowed companies to\ndrive real business value from the technology. Image recognition is a common\napplication area of narrow AI. It allows mapping an image\u2019s key physical points\nagainst a \u2018learning network\u2019 that provides the possible meaning of those\npoints. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be used in digital marketing for automatically\ntagging images in a digital asset management (DAM) software. Another key use in\ndigital marketing is optimization. Narrow AI can help to optimize conversion by\nallowing you to determine pricing, targeted offers, promotions etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having far greater value that simply giving customers a\n\u2018good offer\u2019, personalizing the user experience\/customer journey to understand\nthe user and predict their needs can help create loyal customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because personalizing the user experience\/customer journey with AI allows businesses to create meaningful connections that increase engagements and are based on much more than just a \u2018good offer\u2019. Using marketing-driven personas to create great user experiences and customer journeys can be effective. However, they alone are often not enough. Persona recognition may be needed too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Persona Recognition<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Image recognition generates a match through the use of key physical\ncharacteristics. On the other hand, persona recognition uses key behavioral\ncharacteristics to do the same. Persona recognition begins with the use of AI\nto perform data analysis and discover behavioral affinities\u2019 clusters. These\nare the correlations among users that show similar patterns of interactions and\ndecision making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, these patterns are converted into insight-driven\npersonas that can be used for targeted activities in the next stage of the\nprocess; this is the stage where it is possible to observe and match users in\nreal time against the personas that are inferred.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final stage of persona recognition involves the use of\nAI, based on experimentation and observation, to come up with content, paths,\nand other user experience parts that AI finds to be the best for each persona.\nThis could either be driven completely by AI or it could be experimentation\ncontrolled by humans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How AI is Helping Transform the\nDigital Experience Through Personalized Intelligence<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating and delivering personalized content and user\nexperiences not only makes users\/customers feel that they are understood, but\nit also makes them feel valued. This can be immensely powerful in creating\nloyal customers. Therefore, personalizing content and user experiences is\ninvaluable and you can do that at scale with AI technology. Following are some\nways AI is helping transform the digital experience through personalized\nintelligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. AI-Powered Content Personalization<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More than half of content marketers today <a href=\"https:\/\/offers.adobe.com\/en\/na\/marketing\/landings\/_46316_real_time_marketing_insights_study.html\">struggle\nwith personalization<\/a>. This is a cause of concern since customers today are\nincreasingly wanting experiences with brands that are unique and personalized.\nCustomers want to build deeper connections with the businesses they patronize,\nand marketers must take a serious note of this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that AI-powered solutions make it easier to\ndevelop content marketing strategies that align with the unique needs of an\nindividual customer. They do this by automating the type of content, the\ncommunication channels, and even the timing of content delivery. Additionally,\nAI enables marketers to create customized customer experiences by allowing them\nto perform in-depth analysis of various data patterns. This is known as\npredictive personalization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In predictive personalization, the available data is\nanalyzed and tools for customer profiling are used to automatically optimize\nconversions by adapting content in real-time. Powered by ML algorithms, this\nenables a high level of personalization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An example of this would be the use of customer data, such\nas browsing history, flights and hotels booked in the past, and social media\nactivity, by a travel company to come up with locations and type of activities\nthat are likely to appeal each customer and then customizing marketing messages\nbased on this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI allows you to be smart with your ads. This means that you\ncan create smarter and more personalized digital ads and campaigns by using the\ndata made available by the AI technology. Algorithms and big data are used by\nAI and ML to create better insights for your marketing team; they study social\nmedia profiles, keyword queries, and other relevant data online to come up with\nthese insights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any marketer that utilizes ad spend to promote their\ncompany, achieving ad efficiency is critical. Luckily, achieving this\nefficiency has become easier thanks to AI\/ML- based platforms such as Google\nAdWords and Facebook Ads Manager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you can use optimize the delivery of your ads\nprior to the launch of a campaign by setting goals with Facebook\u2019s Ad Manager.\nThe course for the delivery of your ads will be charted by these goals from\nconversions to reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebooks Ads can help to reduce your cost per click (CPC)\nby allowing you to deliver ads to users that are likely to click through\ninstead of targeting ads to users that have a 50\/50 chance of converting.\nGoogle Ads big strategies are another example of AI and ML in paid media that\nhelp to optimize your cost per click. Here, ML tools can be used to analyze the\nperformance of ads, get recommendations, and make any alternations that are\nneeded. Ultimately, this helps to reduce\/optimize your cost per click of Google\nAds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Personalized Customer Service<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalized customer service entails much more than simply\nsending out an automated message or mail that addresses a customer by name. To\npersonalize customer service, you not only need to capture the attention of the\ncustomer, but you also need to an create authentic engagement that is relevant\nat every stage of the customer journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lack of trust and personalization has resulted in over <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.accenture.com\/news\/us-consumers-turn-off-personal-data-tap-as-companies-struggle-to-deliver-the-experiences-they-crave-accenture-study-finds.htm\">40\npercent of consumers in the U.S<\/a> abandoning a brand and moving onto a\ncompetitor. The implementation of innovative approaches that deeply resonate\nwith customers is needed by organizations to create a truly personalized\ncustomer experience; this is a user experience that leaves customers feeling\nappreciated and value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advances in ML tools and algorithms in the past few\nyears have enabled AI-solutions, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, to\nlearn how to provide customer service, including learning the ways to respond\nto and engaged with customers. But, can these solutions help deliver\npersonalized customer experiences? Yes, they can. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use AI to harness large volumes of data from\nmultiple sources and find patterns in customer behavior that allows you to\nperform mass personalization. In order to create a specific profile of each\ncustomer, AI utilizes the customer\u2019s interaction history. This helps it to find\npatterns in customer behavior which in turn allows the delivery of highly\npersonalized experiences to increase customer engagement and improve customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. AI-Recommendation Systems<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 40 percent of the people that shop online would prefer\nshopping on a website that makes <a href=\"http:\/\/www.intelliverse.com\/blog\/the-power-of-personalized-product-recommendations\">personalized\nrecommendations<\/a>. Products tailored to the preferences of individual\ncustomers can be offered on websites using recommendation engines. A real-world\nexample of this is Amazon\u2019s recommendation engine that helps to generate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.martechadvisor.com\/articles\/customer-experience-2\/recommendation-engines-how-amazon-and-netflix-are-winning-the-personalization-battle\/\">35%<\/a>\nof all of the company\u2019s sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A system that filters information about users, an AI\nrecommendation engine can make suggestions to users based on the preferences,\ninterests, and past behavior. Based on this customer profile, the specific\ninterests\/ preferred items of a specific user can be predicted. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recommendations systems make the customer journey and user\nexperience seamless by allowing customers to find the items they want easily\nand quickly. &nbsp;On the other hand,\nconversational AI platforms, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, are\nhelping businesses to reduce their customer service costs by as much as <a href=\"https:\/\/chatbotsmagazine.com\/how-with-the-help-of-chatbots-customer-service-costs-could-be-reduced-up-to-30-b9266a369945%5D?gi=107cb7d1a85d\">30\npercent<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Real-World Examples of AI Use to\nImprove Personalization<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following are some real-world examples of how the use of AI is\nhelping to personalize user experiences and customer journeys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Thread<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thread, a fashion company based in the UK, makes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clickz.com\/how-fashion-brand-thread-is-delivering-hyper-personalized-emails-at-scale\/113231\/\">personalized\nrecommendations about clothing<\/a> to each customer by utilizing AI. Data is\nacquired from customers through style quizzes. Additionally, personalized\nrecommendations are sent to customers each week and they can vote these\nrecommendations up or down. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This allows the company to find patterns in customer\u2019s\npreferences and likes which in turn helps to make personalized recommendations.\nThe more data the company has about a customer, the better recommendations it\ncan make to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Hilton Hotels<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hilton Hotels personalizes that experiences of its guests to\nmake them more enjoyable by using Connie, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/travel\/roadwarriorvoices\/2016\/03\/09\/introducing-connie-hiltons-new-robot-concierge\/81525924\/\">robot\nconcierge<\/a>. Standing a little over a foot tall in the lobby, the robot not\nonly greets incoming guests, but it also answers their questions. Connie uses\nits natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to make personalized\nrecommendations to guests about the places to visit and the eateries to try.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Macy\u2019s<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An smartphone-based AI assistant, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/blogs\/watson\/2016\/07\/artificial-intelligence-transforms-store-shopping-experience-pilot-macys-call\/\">\u2018On\nCall\u2019 virtual assistant of Macy\u2019s<\/a> helps to personalize the in-store\nexperience for customers. After they enter the store, customers can use their\nphone to start chatting with Macy\u2019s digital assistant. The virtual assistant\ndirects the shopping experience of customers by asking them questions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the answers of the customers, the On Call assistant\nprovides products recommendations and directions to their location in the\nstore. Additionally, if the virtual assistant finds that the customer is\ngetting frustrated, it will alert a human customer service rep to take control\nof matters. This makes the assistant a truly remarkable technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Word<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By personalizing the interaction and user experience at\nevery stage of the customer journey, AI and ML based tools can increase\ncustomers\u2019 engagement with a brand and deliver individualized experiences that\ncan create customer loyalty.&nbsp; All of this\nbenefits the bottom line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next article in this series, we will look at how AI\ncan be used to analyze large volumes of data to find meaningful patterns and\nanomalies.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3302,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[85],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3296"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3296"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3296\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3301,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3296\/revisions\/3301"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3302"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3296"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3296"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3296"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
