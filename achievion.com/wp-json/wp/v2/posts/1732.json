As a result, this year is expected to be a crucial stage for blockchain for enterprise that will see the leap of blockchain projects from proof-of-concept to full deployments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With so much potential, blockchain technology is well on its way to becoming widely adopted. A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/steemit.com\/technology\/@claudiop63\/blockchain-adoption-rates-how-fast-and-where\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">recent report from McKinsey &amp; Company<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a leading management consulting firm, predicts that maturity and widespread adoption of blockchain will happen by 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In fact, many signs point to the fact that the tipping point for blockchain adoption has arrived. Here are 5 signs that we believe back the predictions that blockchain is ready to go mainstream.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1. Blockchain Developers Are in High Demand<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A recent report from Juniper Research found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/07\/31\/blockchain-technology-considered-by-57-percent-of-big-corporations-study.html\">57 percent of large corporations<\/a> are considering or are already in the process of deploying blockchain technology. With so much demand for blockchain talent, a shortage of blockchain developers has already emerged. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/cryptocurrency-job-openings-double-in-last-6-months\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AngelList<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, blockchain job posts have tripled since 2016. In November 2017, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cryptocoin.news\/news\/more-blockchain-ready-developers-needed-iohk-trains-students-in-haskell-code-3491\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CryptoCoin News reported<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that the number of blockchain-related LinkedIn job postings more than tripled in the past year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With so many job openings and so few qualified applicants to fill these positions, companies can&#8217;t simply sit back and wait for future college graduates with the right skills. Instead, they are retraining their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z-GTqYi00OE\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">existing workforces<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for specific blockchain development functions or paying a premium to attract top-notch, experienced blockchain talent.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2. Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) Platforms Emerge<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By the end of 2018, global spending on blockchain solutions is expected to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vccircle.com\/global-spending-on-blockchain-solutions-to-reach-2-1-bn-in-2018-idc-report\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">reach $2.1 billion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, according to IDC. By 2025, global revenue from enterprise blockchain applications is expected to rise from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/dwblog\/2017\/blockchain-jobs\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">$2.5 billion to $19.9 billion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To meet this demand, major companies are investing in blockchain. While some companies are working on creating consumer-facing applications, other companies such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/blockchain\/\">IBM<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/solutions\/blockchain\/\">Microsoft<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/cloud\/blockchain\/index.html\">Oracle<\/a> are launching Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms that companies can use to develop their own blockchain projects. These efforts include cloud services and blockchain development solutions for specific industries.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3. Cybersecurity Concerns Reach New High<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The year 2017 delivered some of the biggest cyberthreats in recent history as thousands of businesses and millions of consumers were affected by everything from cyberattacks to data breaches. As a result, centralized systems are increasingly being considered as a major security risk for businesses that manage and process transactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blockchain is tamper-proof and doesn&#8217;t require the intervention of third-party services for transaction processing and verification. With cybersecurity becoming a top concern for companies across the globe, old methods of managing transactions have simply become outdated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Companies are rapidly naming blockchain as the solution that will replace these outdated legacy systems, with the goal of using blockchain for recording and validating transactions.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4. Artificial Intelligence Meets Blockchain<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The fact that a synergy between blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged is another sign that the tipping point for blockchain adoption has arrived. Blockchain provides transparency and dramatically improves security enabling safe AI application deployment without the need for a third-party intermediary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Given blockchain&#8217;s ability to deal with vast amounts of data, the combination of these technologies could create the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investors.com\/research\/industry-snapshot\/bitcoin-blockchain-technology-disruption-private-industry\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">foundation for Internet 3.0<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> according to Colin Sebastian, analyst at RW Baird.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Already, there are major examples of AI and blockchain collaboration. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/doc.ai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">doc.ai<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, health metadata collection platform, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/neuromation.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Neuromation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a synthetic data platform for deep learning, are two solutions that are already in production.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5. Organizations Collaborate to Further Blockchain Technology<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Government, research organizations, and companies are recognizing the urgent need to collaborate when it comes to blockchain. These organizations are now asking questions about establishing key standards for blockchain development.\u00a0According to Deloitte, <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/insights\/us\/en\/focus\/signals-for-strategists\/emergence-of-blockchain-consortia.html#endnote-2\">more than 40 consortia<\/a> have been formed globally to explore blockchain and distributed ledger technology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition, companies are working together to deploy open source solutions to further the development of the technology. Finally, governments are also exploring the legal implications of smart contracts and other aspects of blockchain technology in order to establish a regulatory environment for companies looking to deploy blockchain.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blockchain Still Has Hurdles to Overcome<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite the promising use cases for blockchain, there are still a number of obstacles that the technology will need to overcome before it truly becomes mainstream. Like many rapidly evolving technologies that have come before, blockchain&#8217;s recent adoption has far outpaced the ability of governments to issue clear guidance regarding its use. In industries where companies face a myriad of compliance concerns, there isn&#8217;t exactly a rush to get out ahead of regulators.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blockchain also comes with high initial costs for companies looking to make the transition. Various aspects of the business, not just IT, need to be adjusted in order to successfully implement blockchain. Other concerns include the viability of proposed use cases and finally whether or not key standards for blockchain development will be established.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Exploring Blockchain for Business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While blockchain could potentially offer enormous savings in terms of streamlining business processes, the urgency in making these changes is something that most businesses must strongly evaluate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a result, identifying and mitigating risk should be a part of the conversation when it comes to blockchain. With the right strategic implementation, blockchain could potentially become a critical component for the growth of your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The next several years will see blockchain move from a speculative investment to a critical business technology and now is the time to start exploring.
