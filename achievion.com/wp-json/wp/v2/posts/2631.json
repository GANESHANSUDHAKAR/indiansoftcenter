This should make the news because ML is the mainstay of modern artificial intelligence. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, an increasing number of companies are excelling in their use of machine learning (ML). This is largely due to the affordable computing resources and cloud technologies that have popped up in recent times. With these solutions, it has become easier for companies to leverage AI and ML to deal with Big Data and gain useful insights. In AI software development, it is the pretrained AI\/ML datasets that are making the development process more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In software development, AI or ML models need to be trained on big datasets to make them perform the required task. This would have been a problem without pretrained AI\/ML datasets. Luckily, we have a number of such datasets available, and this makes it possible to collect, process, and analyze data in real-time to speed up the AI software development cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The AI\/ML Categories and How They Help Increase the Efficiency of AI Software Development<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While no one can doubt the importance of AI\/ML datasets in AI software development, the success of these datasets in software development is far from guaranteed. To be successful in software development, the datasets must contain a decent amount of data and should be of good quality. Additionally, they should be free from any bias. If the datasets do not have enough data, lack quality, or are biased, then the results will be poor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find quality AI\/ML datasets, you need to look for the following characteristics:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A dataset that is not messy and can be cleaned quickly<\/li><li>A dataset with few rows or columns. It is easier to work with such a dataset.<\/li><li>A clean dataset, since cleaning a large dataset can take a significant amount of time<\/li><li>A dataset that answers a question\/decision<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping the above in mind, you can start your search for a suitable AI\/ML dataset that can aid you in AI software development. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Dataset Finders<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretrained datasets are one of the best sources for learning an AI\/ML algorithm or trying out an existing framework. They allow you to overcome many of the restrictions or computational restraints faced in building a model from scratch. These pretrained datasets can be used as a benchmark for improving existing models or testing these models against them. The possibilities are endless with pretrained AI\/ML datasets and the search for them is made easy by dataset finders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dataset finders are like a large repository of AI\/ML datasets where you search a variety of datasets housed in different places on the web. With dataset finders, it becomes easy to find an AI\/ML dataset that you can use to test existing models and even improve them. Following are the two most popular dataset finders around:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1.&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Kaggle<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Kaggle is a data science website that features various datasets from external sources. Kaggle\u2019s master list contains several niche datasets. This includes basketball data, ramen ratings, and even some city\u2019s pet licenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A favorite for many, Kaggle allows users searching for a specific dataset type to engage in discussion about the data, develop their own projects in kernels, and find some public code. Each dataset is a tiny community where you can do a lot. Within Kaggle, you will find a broad range of real-life datasets. The datasets differ in format, shape, and size. Each dataset comes with kernels which contain notebooks by different data scientists. The notebooks can be used to analyze the dataset. At times, the notebooks are available with algorithms that resolve the specific dataset\u2019s prediction problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2.&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>UCI Machine Learning Repository<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the UCI ML repository, you can do two things: develop a self-study program and build a strong ML foundation. A dataset source that has been around for some time, the UCI ML repository can be a good first step for finding interesting datasets. However, you need to keep in mind that the datasets are contributed by users and ergo, have varying degrees of cleanliness. On the upside, no registration is needed for downloading datasets from this resource.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The repository contains hundreds of datasets from the University of California\u2019s Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences. Moreover, the datasets in the repository are classified by the type of machine learning problem. &nbsp;The repository contains datasets for regression, univariate and multivariate time-series datasets, and recommendation systems. Some UCI datasets are made available after cleaning so they can be used readily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>General Datasets<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>General datasets are AI\/ML datasets pertaining to the public and government, and finance and economics. These datasets are a good source of financial and economic data. Additionally, they provide key information related to statistics, choices, and surveys in the public and government sphere. Following are three of the most widely used general datasets:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1.&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Data.Gov<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This website allows users to download data from several U.S government agencies. Data.Gov provides users access to a range of data, such as performance scores in school, government budgets, changes in climate, data on public safety and health, and much more. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The federal government\u2019s Executive brand generates the datasets on the website pertaining to a wide variety of subjects. However, additional research is undertaken by users who use the data to meet their objectives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2.&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Google Trends<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best and most interesting general datasets available today is Google Trends.
