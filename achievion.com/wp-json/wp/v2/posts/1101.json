Here are 7 ways to promote your app on social media that are sure to drive results.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Create an App Trailer<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When selecting an app to download from the app store, most customers will look for an app that offers a short video or app trailer. A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/infographics\/shopping-micro-moments-mobile-trends.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that almost 50% of internet users look for videos related to a product or service before visiting a store.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To promote your app in a way that is visually enticing, you can also upload your app trailer to your social media accounts and share them with your followers. Sharing your app trailer on social media increases the chances that your app trailer will go viral, especially if it is shared by the top social media influencers in your industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your app trailer should show the basic functions of your app, as well as, provide an overview of the app\u2019s UI and navigation. You must make sure that your app trailer grabs visitors&#8217; attention within 5 to 10 seconds, otherwise they&#8217;ll leave. Show your visitors the key benefits of using your app and why they should choose your app over the competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Share App How-to Videos<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your app is a bit more complicated, you can also promote your app by creating how-to videos that explain how to use specific features of your app. In fact, 4 out of 5 consumers believe that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/animoto.com\/blog\/business\/video-marketing-cheat-sheet-infographic\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demo videos are helpful<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These how-to videos are also likely to be shared by other users in order to provide quick support when people need help and can\u2019t reach you right away. For B2B apps, testimonial videos are also highly effective and can help you to turn more freemium users into customers for your app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you create your video content, make sure to create videos for multiple resolution screens. That will make it easier for you to share your videos across a variety of social networking platforms and mobile video ad networks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Connect With Social Media Influencers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For effective app marketing, you can&#8217;t do things alone. In fact, you&#8217;ll absolutely need to develop relationships with the top social media influencers in your niche if you want to give your app promotion a serious boost. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nielsen.com\/us\/en\/press-room\/2012\/nielsen-global-consumers-trust-in-earned-advertising-grows.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nielsen report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 92% of consumers trust recommendations from family, friends and colleagues more than any other form of advertising.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using sources like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn search<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/clarity.fm\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clarity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/buzzsumo.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BuzzSumo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube search<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you can quickly locate the social media influencers who are most prominent in your niche.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get their attention, gradually introduce yourself by following them on their social media accounts, sharing their content, and leaving comments on their posts. Once that relationship is established, send them a personalized pitch asking for them to review your app. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some social media influencers also offer sponsored social media posts, which is another great opportunity to put your business in front of thousands or millions of potential customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Conduct Surveys<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A survey about your app will encourage people to try your app while also providing an opportunity for you to get feedback on your app. You can also ask your social media followers to review and rate your app in the app stores. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sites like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/official\/en_us\/a\/2015\/introducing-twitter-polls.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/apps.facebook.com\/my-surveys\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> already have survey features built into their networks that you can take advantage of. If you prefer to use a third-party service to conduct your survey, extend the reach of your survey by using paid advertising on the social networking platform to promote it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Create Groups<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All successful apps are backed by active community members. If you want to promote your app on social media, consider setting up a group. A group can serve as a place for people to find all of the latest content related to your app. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/mobile-touch\/167970719931213\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook Groups<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the most prominent example of a social media site that offers a group feature and you can add and delete members from your group to help you build a targeted audience for your app.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Run a Contest<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A contest is a great way to attract interest to your app. In addition, users will also have an incentive to check out your app if there is a chance that they might win a prize. If your app is related to a particular niche, such as travel, consider partnering with other companies to boost your audience&#8217;s interest in the available prizes for your contest. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then create a landing page for your app and share it across your social media profiles with occasional updates and the details of the winners and their prizes once the contest has ended. Running a contest also helps you to build a list of subscribers that you can market your app to continuously as your product matures.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Paid Social Advertising<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While low cost methods can be highly effective for promoting your app on social media, if you need a quick boost, paid social advertising is your best bet. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/mobile-app-ads\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook Mobile App Ads<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can drive app installs for your app and you can set your own budget and targeting parameters.
