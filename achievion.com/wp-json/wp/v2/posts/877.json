Single Scrolling Sites<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help websites adapt to a mobile-first world, web developers are creating single scrolling sites that utilize scrolling rather than links as a means of displaying content.

An example of a site that utilizes this effect is <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/urban-walks.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urban Walks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (browse the site to see it in action).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8.

Web design is once again taking on a minimalist approach with a greater emphasis on quality rather than quantity with uncluttered, concise designs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-895\" src=\"http:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/spotify.jpg\" alt=\"spotify\" width=\"720\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/spotify.jpg 720w, https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/spotify-300x141.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Photo Credit: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.spotify.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spotify<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, this means that bolder and larger typography will be trending. With this change, website content will be more legible so that users no longer have to adjust their browsers to read the text on most websites. Spotify is an example of a company that has already adopted this approach by featuring bright colors and a large Sans Serif font headline on the site\u2019s home page.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9.

Unlike PNGs and JPGs, they do not pixelate when they are resized. The use of SVGs will increase in 2017 given the strong trend towards mobile and responsive websites. Already WordPress and Joomla have added support for SVGs and developers are also following suit.

In 2017, you&#8217;ll start to see more bespoke work from videos, to animations and photographs, as more businesses want their designs to be unique to their brand.
