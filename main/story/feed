<h5>Alex Comes to America</h5>
</div>
<div class="story_itm_desc">
<p>The story of Achievion begins with Alex Jacome. In 2003, Alex came to the US from Belarus with $300 in his pocket and a big dream to start a software development company. Why? While working on his Computer Science degree, he LOVED coming up with elegant and simple solutions to complex problems. And, now he wanted to apply this art by helping leaders and organizations who shared the same passion.</p>

<h5>He Optimizes Himself</h5>
</div>
<div class="story_itm_desc">
<p>After putting his suitcase down, he hit the ground running and landed himself a position as a Java Developer at SAIC.</p>
<p>At just 28 years of age, he received a promotion to the position of Solutions Architect within the company. Alex’s organizational vision, innovative ideas, obsession with quality code, and excellent people skills were the main factors that helped to propel his career with the company.</p>

<h5>His Obsession With Seeing Clients Succeed Won’t End</h5>
</div>
<div class="story_itm_desc">
<p>During his time with SAIC, Alex worked with around 200 employees. He learned a lot about software design and building high quality, mission critical software products for a number of large enterprise organizations. He also discovered a new passion – he LOVED seeing clients succeed. With this experience under his belt and a drive to help clients win, Alex decided that it was time to venture out on his own and founded Achievion (from “achieve”, “win”, “succeed”) in 2013.</p>
