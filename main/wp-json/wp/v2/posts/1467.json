A well-known example of machine learning is Netflix&#8217;s algorithms which are designed to give movie suggestions based on your past viewing history.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To provide you with a brief introduction to these algorithms, here are the most common types of machine learning algorithms and their real-world applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine Learning Tasks<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several different ways that an algorithm can model a problem as a result of its interaction with the learning environment or the input data. Here are the four different learning styles in machine learning algorithms:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Supervised Learning. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Input data, which is also called training data, is used by the algorithm until the model receives a desired level of accuracy. In this learning style, the input data has a known label or result. The model is prepared via a training process which requires it to make predictions until a desired level of accuracy can be achieved. Real world examples: stock price prediction, medical imaging.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Unsupervised Learning.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For unsupervised learning, the input data does not have a known label or result. The model is prepared by extracting general rules, to organize the data by similarity, or to create a mathematical process that systematically reduces redundancy. Real world examples: customer segmentation, market basket analysis.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Semi-supervised Learning.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In this learning style, the input data is a mix of labeled and unlabeled data. The model must make predictions. However, it must also learn structures to organize the data. Real world examples: text classification, lane-finding on GPS data.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Reinforcement Learning. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This learning style uses observations that have been gained by interaction with the environment in an iterative fashion. The algorithm continues to learn from its environment until it has explored the full range of possible states. Real world examples: computer played board games, self-driving cars.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common Machine Learning Algorithm<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have a general understanding about the types of machine learning tasks, here are some of the most popular algorithms that are used to solve business problems along with their real-life applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decision Trees<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A decision tree is a supervised machine learning approach that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their potential outcomes, which may include chance-event outcomes, utility, and resource costs. This method makes it possible to approach a \u00a0problem in a structured way in order to arrive at a logical conclusion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decision trees can also be used to assess the number of questions that need to be asked in order to determine the probability of making the right decision in most instances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decision trees can be used in real-world applications such as:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial investment decisions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Company mergers decisions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sales lead qualification<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most popular decision tree algorithms are:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Classification and Regression Tree (CART)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C4.5 and C5.0 (different versions of a powerful approach)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decision Stump<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M5<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conditional Decision Trees<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logistic Regression<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning technique that measures the relationship between a categorical dependent variable and independent variables.
