Many people don\u2019t understand the differences between coders and software engineers because they have been used interchangeably by laypersons for so long. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding what coders and software engineers actually do goes far beyond job titles. In fact, the difference is so vast that most tech executives agree that there is a <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/19\/triplebyte-coding-bootcamp-study\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shortage of talented software engineers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Startups and project managers need to pay closer attention to who they are hiring when searching for a team to build a web or mobile app. While costs are an important factor, so is quality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to achieve your project goals, you need to know how to hire the right people to build your app. Here is our take on the differences between software engineers and coders and what you should know about them before you start your next project.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Is a Coder?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A coder is a person who is capable of writing any basic code using the fundamental concepts of coding. While the job will get done, coders don&#8217;t do defensive coding, such as error catching and validations. An object-oriented coding approach is also not guaranteed as well. While your application might run as expected, it might be very difficult to scale an application built by a coder. That is because coders generally take shortcuts when it comes to the use of technology or tools to get the job done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s also important to understand that these general definitions of a coder versus a software engineer have very little to do with the years of experience or level of education that a coder or software engineer has. In fact, it often tends to have more to do with the individual&#8217;s commitment to delivering a quality product. That is why knowing code does not automatically make someone a good engineer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Is a Software Engineer?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/drexel.edu\/ece\/about\/software-engineering\/\">Drexel University<\/a> defines a software engineer as someone who applies &#8220;the principles and techniques of computer science, engineering, and mathematical analysis to the design, development, testing, and evaluation of the software and the systems that enable computers to perform their many applications. Software engineers must possess strong programming skills, but are often more concerned with developing algorithms and analyzing and solving programming problems than with actually writing code. &#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, everybody who doesn&#8217;t work in sales, marketing or design suddenly decided that they were engineers. In fact, human resources departments have even helped to perpetuate the problem by writing &#8220;software engineer&#8221; as the job title in job descriptions where they actually might have only meant to hire JavaScript coders. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason for this is that the job title engineer is somewhat of an aspirational title in the tech world. That is because to the general public, the title of \u201cengineer\u201d it comes with a certain level of prestige given that engineers in other fields are subject to regulation, undergo certification, and are required to keep up with their fields with continuing education. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, degrees and certifications are not an indicator of a coder or software engineer\u2019s ability to do their job. A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/heres-a-thing-coders-can-skip-college-1427985222\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that looked at the patterns between 10,000 resumes and job performance over a span of 14 years found that there is no correlation between having a computer science degree and being a good coder or software engineer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Should You Hire a Software Engineer?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want a simple piece of software and you aren\u2019t really concerned about the long-term viability of your application, a coder may suffice. However, if you\u2019re building a mobile or web app that you plan to take to market, you absolutely need to hire a software engineer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software engineers are able to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Design, implement, test and maintain software <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn new technologies in order to make use of them in furthering the company\u2019s strategic goals<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep ahead of the technology curve with continuing education<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communicate effectively with other team members in order to keep the project on track<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main difference is that software engineers have a lot of skills that they employ in their daily work beyond just web or app programming. Software engineers are responsible for helping their teams to come up with a plan, deadlines, and the scope of deliverables throughout the duration of the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, software engineers aren&#8217;t hired specifically for their knowledge of a particular programming language. They are expected to instead familiarize themselves with a language \u00a0and learn to use it within the environment that the project demands. As a result, companies that hire software engineers are able to lend the best and the brightest talent to their projects thanks to the software engineer\u2019s ability to adapt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, hiring software engineers is why companies like WhatsApp were able to achieve their growth goals with so few employees. After being acquired by Facebook, the company manages to use just <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2015\/09\/whatsapp-serves-900-million-users-50-engineers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50 engineers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to run its app for its 900 million users. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stop Recruiting and Hire Achievion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Achievion, our job is to deliver a skilled team of experts that can adapt themselves to the needs of your project and that is why we only hire engineers not coders.
