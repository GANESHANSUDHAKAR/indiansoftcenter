By 2022, the AI and machine learning market are predicted to grow at a 44 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/artificial-intelligence-platform-market-worth-988-billion-usd-by-2022-658814893.html\"><u>US$9 billion<\/u><\/a>. In recent years, there have been several developments in AI and machine learning technologies, and the same is expected during the coming year. We will go through some of the most important AI predictions for 2022 in this article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.&nbsp;<strong>There Will Be Mass Adoption of AI by Businesses<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees are more expensive than software. It does not require health insurance or FICA contributions. Even if you employ subscription-based software-as-a-service, you&#8217;re probably saving money compared to hiring someone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI differs from other software in that it does real work rather than supporting employees with their tasks. As a result, AI is a natural choice for cost-cutting strategies. At the very least, when it performs as well as a person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that this happens more frequently than you believe. Nina, a bot created by Swedbank, takes customer calls and answers inquiries, and she succeeds <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/brandlab\/2017\/03\/getting-smart-artificial-intelligence\/\"><u>80 percent of the time<\/u><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That success rate could explain why, by 2022, an estimated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/abi-research-forecasts-almost-one-million-businesses-worldwide-will-adopt-ai-technologies-by-2022-300475890.html\"><u>900,000 businesses<\/u><\/a>&nbsp;will have adopted AI technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.&nbsp;<strong>AI will have a Greater Role in Hyper-Automation<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyper automation is the process of using advanced technologies to automate tasks. Other words for the same thing include intelligent process automation and digital process automation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies can utilize conversational AI and RPA to automatically respond to client inquiries and improve their CSAT score. By automating time-consuming activities, businesses may reduce employee manual work and increase production. Companies can use hyper-automation to infuse digital technologies into their processes. One of the best AI trends is hyper-automation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.&nbsp;<strong>Many Skilled Workers Will Be Replaced by AI Technology<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider a future in which humans are supplanted by relentless, productive robots. It&#8217;s a prevalent theme in science fiction, but it usually involves low-skill or manual laborers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, the pay of menial and physical laborers are so low that large company has no financial incentive to replace them. However, the job security of some expensive and highly qualified professionals may be jeopardized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many jobs in law, finance, IT, and medicine are routine and follow well-defined procedures. Work that is routine, defined, and has a small number of foreseeable outcomes is good for AI. We only pay high prices for these services now because they are performed by professionals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.&nbsp;<strong>We Will Witness the Evolution of Augmented Intelligence<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Augmented Intelligence is one of the most popular AI trends. Augmented Intelligence refers to the use of robots and humans to increase cognitive performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2023, Gartner predicts that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/smarterwithgartner\/gartner-predicts-the-future-of-ai-technologies\"><u>40% of operations and infrastructure teams<\/u><\/a>&nbsp;will use AI-augmented automation to improve IT productivity. In fact, by 2022, digital employees&#8217; contributions will have climbed by 50%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Systems with Augmented Intelligence may gather all types of data from different sources, both structured and unstructured, and display it in a 360-degree view of customers. Travel, retail, healthcare, and financial services are just a few of the areas that are embracing Augmented Intelligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.&nbsp;<strong>Enterprise Metaverse Will Become a Reality in Over Five Deployments Due to 3D Computer Vision<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forrester.com\/report\/predictions-2022-artificial-intelligence\/RES176461?objectid=RES176461\"><u>Forrester<\/u><\/a>, the metaverse \u2014 the merging of real and digital worlds \u2014 is quickly becoming the next big thing in technology. According to the firm, Tencent, Roblox, and Facebook have already made significant investments in space. At the <a href=\"https:\/\/analyticsindiamag.com\/key-announcements-made-at-microsoft-ignite-2021\/\"><u>recent Ignite conference<\/u><\/a>, Microsoft also introduced a metaverse component for its Teams collaboration program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Forrester, the retail metaverse bubble will burst in 2022 due to cryptocurrency and gambling rules, inadequate connectivity for real-time experiences, and other constraints. Meanwhile, as per Forrester, enterprise metaverse solutions will advance toward successful early deployments, allowing hybrid and remote workforces to join.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.&nbsp;<strong>Most Deliveries Will Still Be Made By Humans, Not Drones<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You order pizza, and half an hour later, a drone powered by Artificial Intelligence delivers it to your door. The transaction is completed when you wave your smartphone at the drone to pay. It&#8217;s a good concept, but it&#8217;s impractical in the short run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While drone technology is undeniably amazing and rapidly evolving, it is quick enough for this case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent incidents involving self-driving cars show that AI navigation still has a long way to go. Furthermore, the flight component adds to the complexity of drone navigation. The drone will have to deal with anything from electricity cables to tree branches to birds in real-time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drone delivery also has to account for package weight and size, energy consumption, and the usual legal stumbling blocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.&nbsp;<strong>There Will Be More Business Analysis and Forecasting Using AI and ML<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Business forecasting and analysis utilizing AI and ML have proven to be significantly easier than any previous method or technology. You may use AI and machine learning to consider thousands of matrices to make more accurate predictions and projections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fintech firms, for instance, are employing Artificial Intelligence to forecast demand for different currencies in real-time based on market conditions and client behavior. It enables Fintech companies to have the right amount of supply to meet demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.&nbsp;<strong>Language Modeling Will Improve<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Language modeling makes it possible for machines to interact with humans in a language that both humans and machines understand. It may also convert human languages into computer code that can be used to operate applications and programs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After OpenAI&#8217;s recent release of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.news18.com\/news\/explainers\/explained-can-a-computer-win-a-literature-nobel-gpt-4-could-take-us-closer-to-epic-potential-of-ai-4220339.html\"><u>GPT-4<\/u><\/a>, the heir to the most powerful language model ever constructed, the language modeling process is expected to improve even more next year. GTP-4 will be more potent and larger than GTP-3, with the ability to construct language and carry on conversations that are indistinguishable from those uttered by humans. According to OpenAI, computer code generation will also be improved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9.&nbsp;<strong>Responsible AI Will Take Center Stage<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Responsible AI aids in achieving fairness, even though biases are baked into the data. It helps gain trust, even though openness and explainability procedures are evolving. Finally, AI also helps achieve compliance with regulations while contending with its probabilistic nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2021\/03\/ai-should-augment-human-intelligence-not-replace-it\"><u>David De Cremer and Garry Kasparov<\/u><\/a>&nbsp;wrote in Harvard Business Review that AI-based devices are &#8220;faster, more accurate, more consistently rational,&#8221; but that current AI advances typically lack understanding, emotional maturity, and cultural sensitivity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While end-to-end automation and accompanying employment cutbacks are not among the AI trends for 2022, administrations will need to tackle the moral consequences of AI adoption in their national AI initiatives to ensure favorable automation outcomes for all stakeholders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to business AI, organizations should concentrate on developing intelligent algorithms that explain their conclusions and are not biased against people based on their race, age, gender, religion, or location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get employees on board and motivate them to participate in AI deployment and training, stakeholders must clearly articulate the benefits of automation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10.&nbsp;<strong>AI\u2019s Role in Cybersecurity Will Increase<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the field of cybersecurity, AI has already made significant progress. Because cybercrime is such a serious threat to civilization, the world is always working to prevent it. To keep your data protected from hackers and cyber attackers, AI analyses the traffic on your network and detects intrusions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology and the internet are pervasive in our daily lives. Because we rely so largely on technology, cybersecurity has become a need. For example, banking and finance companies are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to detect fraudulent actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the use of AI, companies are developing new approaches to make cybersecurity more streamlined and risk-free. Businesses are using AI to improve their cloud migration plans and the efficiency of big data technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cybersecurity industry for AI and machine learning is anticipated to reach <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/global-internet-of-things-iot-security-market-to-reach-38-2-billion-by-2026--301365001.html\"><u>US$38.2 billion by 2026<\/u><\/a>. A significant number of data points are involved in cybersecurity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, AI could be used to cluster, classify, analyze, and filter data in cybersecurity. By arranging data in a specific way, AI can help you correlate numerous data sets and look for dangers. You can use AL and ML to identify malware and risks by developing a security platform that scans large amounts of data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>11.&nbsp;<strong>Explainable AI Will Gain Traction<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Explainable AI is a forerunner to the responsible AI tenet, which alleviates a slew of regulatory and compliance difficulties. The combination of AI&#8217;s knowledge foundation and its statistical foundation provides unparalleled explainability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Words are used in reasoning systems because they are more understandable to most people than figures. There are explicit links between outputs and inputs with guidelines. The end-user and the developer both benefit from such explainability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can link back to the fundamental data sources where you acquired the responses when you return search results so that consumers can see the data in context. Developers can observe which cognitive processes are engaged to answer questions, allowing them to simply alter those that are giving incorrect responses to improve them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several model management tools available to make explainable AI for learning systems easier. Top ones provide users with a comprehensive collection of measures for a model&#8217;s performance as well as reveal what was employed when the model was created.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also measurements for defining the evolution of models over time for insight into the underlying infrastructure, environment, and model life so that it keeps track of it when you produce new versions of that model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>12.&nbsp;<strong>Creative AI Systems Will Become Prominent<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creative AI is a new field of Artificial Intelligence that may be used to paint, write captivating stories, make music, and much more. Marketing professionals, for example, will soon be employing AI to compose newsletters and articles, as well as generate designs, thanks to evolving technologies. The effectiveness of AI is far more than we can conceive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although creativity is regarded to be a natural human quality, <a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/africa\/2044477\/south-africa-grants-patent-to-an-ai-system-known-as-dabus\/\"><u>South Africa<\/u><\/a>&nbsp;granted the first patent to a creative AI system in 2021. While the EU and US both dismissed the same patent application on the basis that only humans are eligible for patents, this landmark step toward legal protection and recognition of AI-created goods will spur more innovative AI innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>13.&nbsp;<strong>The Healthcare Industry Will Increase Its Use of AI Technologies<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Big data has been used extensively to identify COVID patients. AI is already making a big and accurate contribution to the healthcare industry. Researchers have also developed thermal cameras and smartphone apps to monitor individual temperatures and gather data for healthcare organizations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By evaluating data and anticipating potential outcomes, Artificial Intelligence may assist healthcare facilities in a variety of ways. AI and machine learning systems offer insights into human health and suggest ways to avoid sickness. AI also enables doctors to keep track of their patient&#8217;s health from a distance, allowing for more teleconsultation and virtual treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>14.&nbsp;<strong>Sustainability in Big Organizations Will Be Driven by AI<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Governments and corporations alike may use AI to minimize dependency on fossil fuels, counteract deforestation, and lower CO2 emissions through 2022 and beyond. While national-level green AI solutions are still rare, we&#8217;ve seen several commercial AI implementations that help organizations achieve their sustainability goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Google&#8217;s data center cooling technology was combined with deep learning, resulting in a <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/the-fourth-wave\/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-by-40-bd3ef8cfe36e\"><u>40% reduction<\/u><\/a>&nbsp;in energy use. Furthermore, Boston Consulting Group&#8217;s CO2 AI, a unique, sustainable AI technology, assists businesses in reducing CO2 emissions by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/markminevich\/2021\/10\/08\/11-examples-of-ai-climate-change-solutions-for-zero-carbon\/?sh=7a3b785b2251\"><u>30\u201340%<\/u><\/a>&nbsp;by precisely evaluating their carbon footprint and generating intelligent recommendations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Word<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is here to stay unless a catastrophic event makes it impossible to use computer technology on the planet. By 2022, it will be in control of a slew of business procedures as well as a substantial chunk of our routines. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will also take over a multitude of time-consuming professional responsibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please contact the Achievion team if you need assistance navigating the above-mentioned AI predictions\/trends or deploying AI technologies.
