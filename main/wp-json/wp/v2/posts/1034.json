But how exactly does speed affect users of web applications? Here is why performance matters when it comes to web application speed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web Application Performance Affects User Interest<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When people use web applications, they want them to deliver fast and efficient performance. As a result, speed has become one of the top metrics that people use to assess the quality of a web application&#8217;s design.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about Google Drive, Slack, or any of the other web applications that you use for your day-to-day business activities. Do you ever expect a slow experience when you use these apps? Would you even consider continuing to use them if they weren&#8217;t fast?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably not, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re still not convinced about the difference that a few seconds make, consider these statistics about web applications:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kissmetrics.com\/loading-time\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kissmetrics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 47% of consumers expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This same study also found that 40% of people abandon websites that take more than 3 seconds to load.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/devonauerswald\/walmart-pagespeedslide\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walmart<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> saw a 2 percent increase in conversion rates for every 1 second improvement in page load times.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/1825005\/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a slowdown of just one second of page load time cost the company $1.6 billion in sales.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These statistics all demonstrate what you probably already know: users want their web applications to work fast and immediately and they won\u2019t stick around if you can\u2019t deliver.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Appearance of a Fluid Experience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to web application speed, speed isn&#8217;t only important for conversions, it&#8217;s also important for giving the appearance of a fluid experience. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, there&#8217;s also a psychological component that affects how users see your web application in terms of quality.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/web\/fundamentals\/performance\/rail\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google research suggests<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that web applications deliver page load times of less than 100 milliseconds, which is the how long the Occipital lobe, or \u201cmemory store,\u201d of the brain stores information as a sensory memory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By limiting page load times to less than 100 milliseconds, you can create the illusion that your web application delivers instantaneous responses to their actions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your web application doesn&#8217;t respond in under 100 milliseconds, the connection between action and reaction breaks and your users will notice the lag.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other end of the spectrum, if a page takes 10 seconds to load, users will grow frustrated and impatient, making it very difficult for them to retain focus on your web application. The result: your web application is deemed to be a low quality application regardless of the content that it offers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, there are instances where it\u2019s impossible to deliver a reaction from your web application within 100 milliseconds. In this instance, your web application should provide some sort of notice to the user that the action is in progress to retain their focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slow Loading Web Applications Lead to &#8220;Web Stress&#8221;<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ca.com\/us\/~\/media\/files\/supportingpieces\/final_webstress_survey_report_229296.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> done at Glasgow Caledonian University found that slowing down web pages during an online transaction resulted in increased agitation and poorer concentration in the study&#8217;s participants. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brain wave analysis further revealed that participants in the study were forced to concentrate up to 50% harder with slow performing websites. Behavioral analysis and EOG technology also found that the subjects experienced greater agitation and stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, humans do not have any control over how their sensory memory responds. Slow loading web applications will cause your users to become stressed no matter how you explain away the slow loading times. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want the best results, it is your job to build your web application to work so that it caters to how users are hardwired to respond.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humans Prefer Routines<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our day-to-day lives, we fall into routines. From waking up to drinking a cup of coffee and heading to work, every day is a series of flows that we don&#8217;t often deviate from unless we do so intentionally. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as an expected change in one&#8217;s day will likely cause stress, a web application that doesn&#8217;t respond as the user thinks it ought to leads to stress as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By delivering fast user experiences, you can allow your users to build routines around your web application\u2019s activities, allowing them to fall into set patterns of use that will help make using your web application one of their normal routines.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delivering a Faster Web Application Experience Is Science<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If anything, these findings reveal that there are some fascinating statistics behind human psychological response and web application performance. If you think that web application speed is only about outdoing the competition when it comes to performance, these findings so just how important web application speed is for increasing user engagement. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to learn more about how Achievion Solutions delivers maximum web application performance, <a href=\"http:\/\/achievion.com\/contact\">contact us today<\/a> and let\u2019s take 30 minutes to chat about your project.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":1040,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[62],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1034"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1034"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1034\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1064,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1034\/revisions\/1064"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1040"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1034"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1034"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1034"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
