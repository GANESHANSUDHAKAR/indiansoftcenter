In order for your app to be successful and profitable, you need to have an active and loyal user base.<\/p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s the trick to getting the growth that you want without spending more than you have to on marketing?<\/p>\n<p>The answer is features.<\/p>\n<p>The better your app is at delivering the features that users want, the more likely your app will be considered to have real world value according to your users.<\/p>\n<p>To help you achieve your new user acquisition goals, we&rsquo;ve put together a list of 7 must-have features that you should consider including in your app to attract new users.<\/p>\n<h2>In-Store Purchase Options<\/h2>\n<p>If your app is designed to promote your physical business locations, then adding features that make in-store purchases easier is a sure to attract new users. One way to do this is by offering a way for customers to pay for items and pick them up in-store.<\/p>\n<p>Starbucks is a stellar example of a company that implemented this feature and has seen their revenues skyrocket as a result. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/3826696-starbucks-sbux-ceo-howard-schultz-q1-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starbucks&rsquo; 1Q16 earnings call<\/a>, the company processes over 6 million Mobile Order &amp; Pay transactions per month and Mobile Order &amp; Pay exceeds 10% of total transactions in many of the busiest stores where morning peak demand is high.<\/p>\n<h2>Coupons \/ Discounts<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to attract new users, offer coupons and discounts through your app. A good example of this can been seen in the retail chain, Walgreens&rsquo; app. Walgreens&#8217; retail app allows customers to look for deals, including sale items and coupons as they shop in store.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/articles\/mobile-app-marketing-insights.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">research from Google<\/a>, 38% of survey respondents reported that they are more likely to download an app when it is required to complete a purchase. However, beyond that it is up to you to deliver other features that will make users stick around instead of simply uninstalling your app.<\/p>\n<h2>Offline Access<\/h2>\n<p>Offering offline access for your app is a great way to increase user session duration and engagement. If there is a high probability that users will want to or need to use your app in places that lack a Wi-Fi signal, then you should consider adding this feature.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, apps like <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.tripadvisor.com\/2014\/07\/03\/new-offline-feature-tripadvisor-app-now-allows-access-tripadvisor-content-even-without-data-connection\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">TripAdvisor<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/mobile.linkedin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn Learning<\/a> allow you to access their app content offline. In addition, connectivity isn&rsquo;t an issue that will simply disappear with better coverage, given the fact that many wireless carriers are limiting their data plans and are <a href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/business\/2016\/03\/att-boosts-data-caps-for-home-internet-and-steps-up-enforcement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">stepping up cap enforcement<\/a>. Therefore, if you want your users to be able to enjoy your app from anywhere, without concerns about roaming charges, offline access is a feature that you should consider.<\/p>\n<h2>Customization<\/h2>\n<p>Allowing users to <a href=\"blog\/mobile-ui-ux-flaws-that-can-ruin-your-mobile-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">customize their app experience<\/a> makes it easier for your app to appeal to new users. Users should be able to adjust settings, such as colors, font sizes, and privacy settings. Try to offer as many customization options as you can. The more customization features your app offers, the less likely you are to create an app that users won&rsquo;t like because they can simply adjust the app to meet their preferences.<\/p>\n<h2>Personalized Content<\/h2>\n<p>Personalized content is especially important for retail apps and can attract new users to your app. This is because users know that your app will deliver an experience that is more tailored to their individual needs than simply browsing your website.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, retailers, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.beaconstac.com\/2016\/04\/6-impressive-location-based-features-that-every-retail-app-should-have\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barneys New York<\/a>, are already using iBeacon technology with their apps to deliver personalized content. The Barneys New York app delivers personalized videos, copy, and look books, in-store to users along with personalized notifications.<\/p>\n<h2>Gamification<\/h2>\n<p>Everyone wants to be a winner and offering gamification allows people to have fun while they use your app. In addition, it also increases the value of your app, giving users a reason to return over and over again. However, keep in mind that unless gaming is the core function of your app, you should also make sure that the game elements are designed to support the overall value that your app delivers.<\/p>\n<p>An excellent example of the use of a gamification strategy is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mint.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mint&#8217;s financial planning app<\/a> that awards scores and titles based on how &#8220;financially fit&#8221; you are. Making financial planning &ldquo;fun&rdquo; is how Mint has continued to dominate the market as one of the leading financial apps. Currently, Mint has a 4 star rating and more than 220,000 reviews in the <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/mint-money-manager-budget\/id300238550?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">App Store<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You should also keep in mind that gamification does not work on users if they are already disengaged. However, encouraging social sharing as a part of your gamification strategy can boost new user acquisition.<\/p>\n<h2>Support<\/h2>\n<p>Everyone hates technical problems. The fastest way to turn off new users is to show them that you don&rsquo;t care about resolving issues with your app. As a result, users will be more likely to download your app if they see that it has the support of an active community and that your team promptly resolves technical issues and responds feedback.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to attract new users, make sure that you give your users an easy way to report bugs and provide feedback on your app, whether it is a button or a link to send an email. Having quality support features for your app can translate to better reviews for your app in the app stores.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The bottom line for any developer is that you can&#8217;t rely solely on a marketing blitz to hit it big with your app. While it might bring some initial attention to your app in the app stores, the success of your app will be short-lived, unless it can deliver on its promises.<\/p>\n<p>Building an app that delivers real value with useful features and a great user experience is the best way to attract new users and convince your existing users to share your app with their friends and colleagues.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, creating a successful app isn&#8217;t the easiest task, but with a commitment to delivering a superior product and some help from experienced mobile app developers, your app will be ready to convert even the toughest of critics.<\/p>\n<p>Ready to build a winning mobile app?
