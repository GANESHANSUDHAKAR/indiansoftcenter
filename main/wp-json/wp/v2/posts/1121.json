Angel investors don&#8217;t only invest seed capital in your startup, they are also making an investment in you and your employees. As a result, they&#8217;ll want to get to know you before any deals are. That&#8217;s why the best way to find an angel investor is the traditional way: through networking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Research who the investors are for your industry and get to know the people in your local business community, including attorneys, accountants, and bankers, who may be able to offer a personal introduction to the right connections. You may find that your efforts pay off once you&#8217;re introduced the person who is willing to make an angel investment in your company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2. Angel Investor Platforms<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many entrepreneurs and investors have turned to online websites, such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/angel.co\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AngelList<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/gust.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gust<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

You&#8217;ll need to create a profile about yourself and your company for angel investors to browse and select companies that interest them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can also look at investor profiles to see who&#8217;s invested in startups like yours previously. However, with these sites there is no magic bullet for obtaining funding. Investors will still want to get to know you and they&#8217;ll also likely want recommendations about your company from a trusted source before they decide to do business with you. However, if you are looking to get a better idea of who might be able to help you grow your business, angel investor websites offer a great start.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3. Angel Associations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An angel group, or angel network, is a group of angel investors who pool their resources in order to invest in a diverse or larger numbers of companies.

Once you&#8217;ve located some individual angel investors or groups, you&#8217;ll need to ask yourself to following questions to help you narrow down your targets:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>What other companies have they invested in? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Angels typically invest in the same types of companies. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Do you have business relationships with or potential contacts at the funded companies? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Angel investors like when the companies they invest in help each other out. It increases the chances that both ventures will be successful. You can increase the odds that your startup will get funded if you can show that you bring something to the table that might help other companies that the angel investor has funded previously.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>What legal or accounting firms does the angel group use? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Getting to know someone at the law firm or accounting firm that the angel investor uses can help you to find contact for a potential introduction or allow you to get a better idea of the ROI that the angel group wants to see in yourself.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your chances of finding an angel investor who can provide the funding that you need will also be much better if you keep the profile of a typically angel investor in mind:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Angel investors generally have a net worth in excess of $1,000,000. They have prior successful entrepreneurial experience and generally look to invest in industries which they are familiar with. Although some angel investors like to cash out in just a few years, most expect that it will take at least five to seven years before their investments full pay off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As you can see, finding an angel investor isn&#8217;t the easiest task. however, your efforts will really pay off once you find someone who is interested in investing in your business. In addition to providing the capital that your business needs, the experience and advice an angel investor can provide will be critical to the success of your company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Have a &#8220;Money Maker&#8221; App Idea?\u200e<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you need help with refining your app idea so that it meets the expectations of potential investors, Achievion Solutions can help. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/achievion.com\/contact\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Contact us<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> today for a free 30 minute consultation.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":1128,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[66],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1121"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1121"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1121\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1126,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1121\/revisions\/1126"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1128"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1121"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1121"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1121"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
