How can you build apps faster? How do your scale app if it is an instant success? How do you make upgrades if there are just a few changes that need to be made right away before you can see adoption across the market?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gartner.com\/smarterwithgartner\/how-to-deliver-enterprise-mobile-apps-faster\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">2014 Gartner survey<\/a> on mobile app development found that the majority of organizations have developed and released fewer than 10 apps, with a significant number of respondents not having released any mobile apps at all. However, this isn\u2019t an indication that businesses don\u2019t want to build apps.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the real reason that they are delivering few or no apps is because developing apps quickly still comes with significant challenges.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to get your app to the market quickly and ensure that it delivers on its promises, you need to create a plan that is specifically designed to drive the results that you are looking for. Here is a quick guide to help you learn how to build apps faster.<\/p>\n<h2>Use a BaaS Provider<\/h2>\n<p>Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) providers offer a way to reduce the costs of backend development and managing the servers. BaaS is a means to hook up your app to a backend that is located in a cloud storage while also providing important features, such as user management, sending push notifications, and connections with various third-party cloud services.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also get other features that will allow you to authenticate users using LDAP and OAuth, use encryption protocols for your app and access firewalled enterprise data.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20160804005076\/en\/Backend-Services-Market-Grow-Impressive-CAGR-102\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Technavio<\/a>, the global BaaS market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 102% during the period 2016-2020 as companies seek to reduce the complexities of app development and improve data privacy and security. Additionally, the growth in the BaaS market will be fueled by increasing demand for features and functionalities from app users.<\/p>\n<p>The benefits of using a BaaS provider are numerous. BaaS makes it easier to scale up your app and ensures user engagement. While you might want to consider building your own infrastructure from the start, it will likely not be cost-effective until you have millions of users.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, BaaS can help you to build your app quickly by eliminating the need to hire an additional backend developer.<\/p>\n<h2>Use Wireframes<\/h2>\n<p>Wireframes are designed to focus on the function of a screen, not exactly what it looks like. They are a tool that is used early in the development process to develop concepts before any coding occurs.<\/p>\n<p>Wireframes allow you to think about your project more carefully before you start any development projects, preventing you from making any lost investments.<\/p>\n<p>Wireframes also enable you to share concepts, get feedback, and get concept approval faster. As a result, wireframes save a lot of money and increase the chances of delivering your app on-time.<\/p>\n<h2>Use Rapid Mobile App Development Tools<\/h2>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http:\/\/forms.kony.com\/rs\/656-WNA-414\/images\/Kony-Enterprise-Mobile-App-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">survey done by Kony<\/a>, over 50% of companies building apps reported using third-party vendor tools. Additionally, the majority of companies believe that is preferable to use an integrated platform from a single vendor with 87% of companies reporting that it is at least somewhat preferable (53%) or highly preferable (31%) to use a single platform.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, many companies are opting to use rapid mobile app development (RMAD) platforms. RMAD platforms offer a variety of tools that promote a \u201clow-code\u201d approach to building apps, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Drag-and-drop codeless tools<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Code generation and orchestration<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Model-driven development<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Virtualization<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Forms construction<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Using RMAD tools can help to speed up the development of an app by allowing those with little to no programming skills to have an impact on the app development process by rapidly assembling app prototypes.<\/p>\n<h2>Adopt a BiModal Approach<\/h2>\n<p>Integration is often the biggest hurdle to meeting the delivery data for an app because many app development teams underestimate the time and resources that are actually required for the integration.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, Gartner recommends that companies replace their traditional approach to development with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gartner.com\/newsroom\/id\/3076817\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">bimodal strategy<\/a>. This approach should consist of two phases:<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf <b>Mode 1<\/b> drives the creation of stable infrastructure and APIs to allow apps to retrieve and deliver data to back-end systems without impacting those enterprise applications.<br \/>\n\u25cf <strong>Mode 2<\/strong> uses high-productivity, agile approaches to quickly deliver front-end app features required by the business.<\/p>\n<h2>Start With One Platform<\/h2>\n<p>Working with one platform will reduce the number of changes that you need to make in response to feedback from beta testing. With fewer changes to make, you can greatly reduce development cycle times.<\/p>\n<h2>Use Libraries, Plugins, and Server Code Snippets<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to building apps, it doesn\u2019t make much sense to reinvent the wheel. As a result, using reusable methods is considered the most effective way to approach app development. Using libraries, plugins, and server code snippets allows you to quickly build server-side app logic and with less coding.<\/p>\n<p>Achievion is an app developer for some of the world\u2019s top companies.
