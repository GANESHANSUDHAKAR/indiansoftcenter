In the past decade, we have witnessed much\nadvancement in the AI field, with major developments taking place in AI in\nrobotics, big data, transportation, and many other AI application areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Market Watch, the AI market value will grow\nfrom <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/press-release\/artificial-intelligence-market-2019-share-trends-segmentation-and-forecast-to-2025-cagr-of-362-2019-08-12\">US$23.95\nbillion in 2018 to US$208.48<\/a> billion by 2025. With the growth of the AI\nmarket, research in the field is also growing. Currently, the United States is\nleading the way in AI research. However, China is not too far behind. In fact,\nmany experts expect China to overtake the US in AI research in the next few\nyears.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past few years, China has made great strides in the\nfield of AI research. In 2018, more than <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/ai2-blog\/china-to-overtake-us-in-ai-research-8b6b1fe30595\">26%\nof the most-cited 10% of papers on AI<\/a> were authored in China. The US\u2019s\nshare stood at 29% in 2018, which is a steep decline from 47% in 1982. Nevertheless,\nboth China and the United States are increasing efforts in AI research to come\nup with AI solutions that can benefit the current and future generations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI efforts of the two countries are finally starting to\nbear fruit. We are now witnessing AI match human intelligence and capacity in\nmany fields. In fact, it is taking over many areas previously dominated by\nhumans. These include (but are not limited to) language transition, speech and\nfacial recognition, and business decision-making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this is just the beginning of what is to come. Over\nthe next decade, we are expecting several major developments and breakthroughs\nin AI that can potentially solve many of today\u2019s problems and in doing so,\nchange how we live our lives. Some of these future developments and breakthroughs\nin AI are discussed here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to Expect in AI in the Next\nDecade?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past few years, many new applications of artificial\nintelligence (AI) have been discovered. To be at the forefront of this AI\ninnovation, many businesses and governments around the world are increasing\ntheir AI efforts. As a result, some of the <a>emerging\ntrends in AI <\/a>include increased government investments in AI, a greater\nfocus on data-driven business decisions, work automation, and the use of\nintelligent technology to get better insights into customer behaviors.\nFollowing is a brief discussion on each of these AI trends that we can expect\nto see more of in the next decade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1.&nbsp;More Government Investments in AI<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The greatest potential of AI lies in the opportunity to\nsolve many of the pressing problems facing humanity today. By leveraging AI, human\nsociety can find innovative and effective ways to solve major world issues such\nas economic inequality and climate change. AI can assist in the resolution of\nthese problems by providing accurate predictions and suggestions about them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another area where AI can be utilized to bring improvements is\nmedical diagnoses. With AI, there is the potential to not only make an accurate\ndiagnosis, but there is also an opportunity to treat some major diseases by\ndetecting them early.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that many governments around the world have\nstarted to take notice of this. The potential of AI to solve many of the world\u2019s\nmost pressing problems is what led the US to implement a comprehensive strategy\nfor researching and developing AI in 2016.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the US government is focusing its AI efforts and\ninvestments on areas such as social welfare, urban systems, environmental\nsustainability, and public health. In 2017 alone, the US government spent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.govini.com\/research-form\/?post_title=DoD%20ARTIFICIAL%20INTELLIGENCE,%20BIG%20DATA%20AND%20CLOUD%20TAXONOMY&amp;post_link_redirect=http:\/\/www.govini.com\/research-item\/dod-artificial-intelligence-and-big-data-taxonomy\/&amp;post_id=4026\">over\n$7 billion on AI<\/a> and related fields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US government is not the only one investing heavily in\nAI; the European Union (EU) is also making major investments in AI development.\nThe EU has pledged to invest up to <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/IP_18_3362\">20\nbillion Euros in AI research<\/a> and innovation in both the public and private\nsectors by 2025. Another major AI investor in China has announced plans to\ninvest about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/arthurherman\/2018\/08\/30\/chinas-brave-new-world-of-ai\/#72102f1928e9\">$150\nbillion<\/a> in the field by 2030. The idea is to establish itself as the\ndominant force in AI globally for many decades to come. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.&nbsp;Increase in Data-Driven Decisions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Until recently, the impact of AI technology was seen only in\nthe technology and financial services sector. However, today, its potential is\nrecognized across many industries; businesses in many varying industries are\nnow adopting AI to improve their decision-making and gain a competitive\nadvantage. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More and more businesses today are focusing on using AI to\nimprove decision making because the success of any business depends largely on\nthe decisions that are made for it every single day. AI makes this easier by\nallowing organizations to analyze large amounts of data that otherwise would\nhave impossible for the relevant people at the company to handle and extract\nvaluable insights from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Work Automation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been many occasions in human history where we\nhave witnessed huge leaps in productivity and wealth; most of this can be\ncredited to the developments and breakthroughs in work automation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discovery of tools made it easier to complete tasks\neffectively while the industrial revolution enabled never-before-seen\nproductivity. Now, AI and robotics are promising to automate the manufacturing\nand operational processes completely, and this could potentially enable\nproductivity levels ten times greater than those witnessed during the second\nindustrial revolution. This will help businesses to maximize profits and ensure\neconomic prosperity in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4.&nbsp;Better Insights into Customer Behaviors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With AI, businesses everywhere have a real opportunity to\ntake their customer relationship management (CRM) to a level never achieved\nbefore. Why do we say this? Because AI makes it possible for organizations to\nanalyze large amounts of data related to customer behavior and associated\nmetrics. As a result, businesses can create personalized messages targeted\ntowards a specific segment of customers to ensure their satisfaction.\nUltimately, this digital marketing tactic helps to increase sales for the\nbusiness and build a loyal customer base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are 4 of the major AI trends that we can expect to see\nmore of in the next decade. We can also expect to see some major AI developments\nand breakthroughs in the next decade. These major AI developments and breakthroughs\nare discussed next.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Major Developments\/Breakthroughs in\nAI in the Next Decade<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What will AI look like in ten years from now? More\nimportantly, how will the evolution of AI in the next decade change our\nlives?&nbsp; These are some of the most commonly\nasked questions regarding the future of AI and its impact on our lives. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most experts believe that AI\u2019s impact on the future world\nwill be largely positive. These positives will come in the shape of the\nfollowing major developments and breakthroughs in AI that are anticipated in\nthe next decade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1.&nbsp;Deep Reasoning<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to experts, a major contributor to AI\u2019s growth in\nthe next ten years will be deep reasoning (DL). We are already witnessing the\nimpact of deep reasoning on AI in the shape of natural language processing\n(NLP), speech, and vision. In the future, we will see deep reasoning helping\nmachines, which will enhance many applications of AI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With deep reasoning assisting them, AI-enabled machines will\nbe able to perform a variety of cognitive tasks better, such as dealing with\nchanging situations, perform basic planning, and make complex decisions related\nto a business function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Improved Deep Learning<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major development in the AI in the next decade is\nconstantly improving deep learning. This will lead to many AI breakthroughs in\nthe next ten years. To apply DL models at scale across a diverse and complex\nrange of tasks, organizations will be required to increase their efficiency at\ntraining deep learning models. This efficiency will be enabled partly by\nincreased use of unsupervised learning and partly by \u2018\u2019small data.\u2019\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be trained, neural networks of DL models need to be\nexposed to massive amounts of data. This means that millions of images may be\nrequired to train a neural network to recognize an object. It can be both\ntime-consuming and costly to acquire relevant datasets of this magnitude.\nTherefore, it won\u2019t be long before small datasets replace big data as the\nenabler of AI innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, some of the developments in unsupervised\nlearning in the next decade that will help to speed, and scale DL applications\ninclude breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and active\nlearning. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;New Hardware and Efficient Algorithms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to speed up AI innovation and application\nperformance is by simplifying the learning process. Graphics Processing Units\n(GPUs) have indeed helped increase the speed of training and running DL\nmodels.&nbsp; However, this is not enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computational complexity cannot be overcome with hardware\nalone. Instead, a combination of hardware development and algorithmic\nimprovement is needed to accelerate the training and implementation of DL\nmodels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI hardware that could lead to this new reality is currently\nunder development. These include quantum computing systems and neuromorphic\nchips. However, the new wave of AI innovation around DL models will involve the\ncreation of an AI system that can mimic the thought patterns of humans, such as\nperception and reasoning. This will enable truly intelligent deep learning\nmodels that can think for themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Word<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As seen above, artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving at a\nrapid pace. In the next decade, several major developments and breakthroughs\nare expected in AI. These major developments will help AI become a part of\nevery commercial sector and play a bigger role in solving some of the most\npressing problems facing the world today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3078,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[85],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2978"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2978"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2978\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3080,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2978\/revisions\/3080"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3078"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2978"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2978"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/achievion.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2978"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
