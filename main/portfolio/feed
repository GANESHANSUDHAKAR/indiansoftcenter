<li>and finally built the AI service that greatly exceeded the accuracy of the existing forecasting software.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
Once the initial ML model has been developed, we implemented the automated retraining mechanism to ensure the Service keeps improving on its own when new data becomes available. 
</div>
<div class="project-info result">
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>Product sales prediction process got a major accuracy boost which improved company operations by a significant margin.</p>
