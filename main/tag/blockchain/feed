										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Two technologies that are leading change and innovation in almost every industry are the blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI). Considering this, a question often comes into mind: What would happen if the AI and blockchain technologies intersected? Let’s find out.</p>



<h2><strong>The Synergy Between Blockchain and AI Can Help Create a Better Tomorrow</strong></h2>



<p>There are several benefits of the synergy between blockchain and AI. Often referred to as collective intelligence, the collaboration of AI with a decentralized ecosystem such as blockchain is expected to change the landscape of the digital economy. The collaboration between AI and blockchain isn’t just for the future. Instead, it is already happening. Example of this is the blockchain-based marketplace SingularityNet. In December 2017, the company held an ICO and it was able to raise over <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/singularitynet-announces-36mln-ico-funding-for-ai-platform-expansion">$35 million</a>.</p>



<p>Another company Neuromation that provides deep learning applications with a data platform made <a href="https://medium.com/neuromation-blog/neuromation-sells-60m-ntk-in-just-8-hours-d09f743123ec">$50 million token sale</a>&nbsp;in only eight hours. There are other companies as well that are trying to combine AI and blockchain technologies for a better tomorrow. An example of this is <a href="https://doc.ai/">doc.ai</a>, a solution that aims to achieve quantified insights about healthcare and biology. In short, the convergence of AI and blockchain is the beginning of a new era. This is enabled by the individual capabilities of both the AI and blockchain technology. What are these capabilities? Let’s look.</p>



<h2><strong>Benefits of the Blockchain Technology</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>A technology widely applied in a range of fields and business sectors, the blockchain technology had made economic transactions seamless and more transparent. Additionally, the value added by the blockchain technology is increasing by the day. According to Gartner, the blockchain technology will grow to over <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/insights/blockchain">$3 trillion</a>&nbsp;by the year 2030.</p>



<p>Additionally, IDC predicts that spending on blockchain will increase to <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS44150518">$11.7 billion</a>&nbsp;by 2022. Today, almost 70% of the banks worldwide are experimenting with blockchain technology to make their processes more transparent, seamless, and secure. It is predicted that these banks will be able to save billions of dollars each year by embracing blockchain.</p>



<p>The key features of blockchain that are driving its adoption include transparency, immutability, data protection, distributed ledger, and decentralized database. There are several advantages of embracing the blockchain technology. One of them is that blockchain is decentralized. This means that data on a blockchain network can be shared without a ‘central authority’. The benefit of this is that transactions can be verified and processed without any central force.</p>



<p>The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures its consistency and durability. Since there is no central point in blockchain vulnerable to attack, the technology can withstand hostile attacks on its systems. Finally, blockchain technology ensures the accuracy of timelines, information, and authenticity.</p>



<p>We cover a lot of business benefits that the distributed ledger technology generates in our <a href="https://achievion.com/tag/blockchain">Blockchain blog series</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The artificial intelligence (AI) industry is growing at a rapid pace. According to PWC, AI could contribute over <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/analytics/assets/pwc-ai-analysis-sizing-the-prize-report.pdf">$15 trillion</a>&nbsp;to the global economy in 2030. Additionally, it is predicted that the global AI market will grow to <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/artificial-intelligence-market-74851580.html">$190 billion</a>&nbsp;in worth by the year 2025. The prediction for the current year is that AI will be used in <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS43185317">40% of digital transformations</a>. </p>



<p>In the next few years, we will also see a proliferation of AI-enabled voice assistants. Moreover, companies using AI will deprive the companies not using the technology for insights of <a href="https://go.forrester.com/press-newsroom/">$1.2 trillion a year</a>&nbsp;worth of revenue. This is how important artificial intelligence (AI) will be in the future. Even today, AI is providing users with several benefits. These benefits are enabled by the key features of the AI technology which include data mining, personalization, error reduction, better data management, real-time assistance, and future prediction.</p>



<p>The advantage of employing AI is that unlike humans, machines never get tired and they can thrive even in the most hazardous of conditions. As a result, they can perform tasks such as mining and space exploration with relative ease. For businesses, trusting AI with data analysis is one of the best decisions they can make. This is because AI can ensure accuracy in data analytics by easily analyzing unstructured data and providing results in real-time.</p>



<p>For more examples of AI benefits across various industries see our <a href="https://achievion.com/tag/ai">AI blog series</a>.</p>



<p>With the individual benefits of the blockchain technology and AI discussed, let’s find out how the integration of these technologies can help bring about a better tomorrow.</p>



<h2><strong>How the Convergence of AI and Blockchain is the Beginning of a New Era</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Today, AI and blockchain are two of the most prominent innovations facing organizations. While most organizations are focused on leveraging these technologies separately, a few are looking towards the convergence between. So, how will the convergence between AI and blockchain impact the enterprise?</p>



<p>Many of the problems that enterprises have been facing since a very long time can be overcome with the integration of AI with blockchain. On one hand, blockchain allows the exchange of valuable data with complete transparency. On the other hand, AI can leverage this data to provide valuable insights with any human assistance. AI can help to build an incredibly secure transaction and encrypted data exchange ecosystem by driving immutability in a blockchain network. Additionally, the convergence of AI and blockchain can enable organizations to execute business transactions with governmental knowledge. This, in turn, can help organizations to drive business growth over the next quarter, year, decade, and beyond. </p>



<p>With blockchain, AI can be decentralized and made open. On the other hand, AI can equip blockchain with the intelligence it needs to work through silos and perform data analysis in a better way. Following are some of the benefits of combining AI with blockchain.</p>



<h3><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Decentralized Intelligence</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) can help blockchain to take the leap forward. Transactions in a blockchain network will be more secure if it is powered by AI algorithms. AI capabilities such as multidimensional data transformations, natural language processing, and image recognition can streamline blockchain P2P link in real-time. Additionally, AI can help to optimize the transaction data in the blocks. This makes the transaction process faster.</p>



<p>In addition to the above, the power of machine learning intelligence can enhance transactional flexibility. Moreover, organizations can develop cost-effective and distributed AI services through specific events and then use smart contracts to ensure their availability.</p>



<p>On the other hand, there are several problems with existing AI-driven business models. These include fraudulent contracts, abuse of data, privacy concerns, and more. Because of this, creating fully open data systems is nearly impossible.</p>



<p>AI requires seamless access to the data from the entire business ecosystem to produce the most accurate decision. Blockchain can ensure this. This is because there is no central authority in the blockchain network and all parties will be more willing to share data. </p>



<p>Also, the consensus algorithm would ensure that the data in the blockchain does not lose its credibility by helping to avoid such a scenario. Once AI gets access to data supply from multiple stakeholders, it can dig deep into the data to understand behavior and patterns and come up with insights never witnessed before.</p>



<h3>2<strong>.&nbsp;Enhanced Data Protection</strong></h3>



<p>AI depends heavily on the data provided to it by humans. Additionally, it improves this data through machine learning. AI looks to gather data about the interactions between humans and other details. With blockchain, you can encrypt data on a decentralized system to run a completely protected and secure database that can be accessed only by authorized users. So, when you combine AI with blockchain, you establish a secure decentralized AI system that contains sensitive information such as financial or medical data. In short, the convergence of AI and blockchain can enhance data protection.</p>



<h3>3<strong>.&nbsp;Increased Trustworthiness</strong> of AI systems</h3>



<p>The combination of AI and blockchain can help to make the AI system more trustworthy. This is great news since the credibility of a system depends on its trustworthiness. Compared to a closed system, such as AI, blockchain is a far more transparent technology. Data is encrypted in blockchains and it can be accessed only by authorized users. </p>



<p>Therefore, it is virtually impossible for unauthorized people to view anything on the blockchain network. This increases the trustworthiness of the blockchain network. When blockchain is combined with AI, then the trustworthiness of the AI system also increases.</p>



<h3>4<strong>.&nbsp;Enhanced Efficiency</strong> of Blockchain</h3>



<p>The cost of executing a P2P transaction in blockchain quickly and effectively is roughly <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/Innovation/deloitte-uk-blockchain-full-report.pdf">$600 million per year</a>. A major reason for this is that the same task is executed by each node on its own copy of data. This occurs because each node wants to be the first to arrive with a solution. With AI, this situation can be improved. </p>



<p>This is because AI can identify the node which will be the first to deliver the solution. Additionally, it can inform all other nodes to stop with their efforts. The benefit of this is reduced costs and upgraded efficiency in the entire system.</p>



<h3>5<strong>.&nbsp;Increased Security</strong> of AI</h3>



<p>It is easy for hackers to infiltrate an AI system and makes changes to it since it is a centralized system operating on a single processor. On the other hand, information needs to go through several phases on the blockchain system before it is accepted on processed. This makes it increasingly difficult to hack the blockchain technology. Therefore, a decentralized, blockchain-based AI platform would be far more difficult to hack than a traditional AI system.</p>



<h3>6<strong>.&nbsp;More Effective, Scalable, and Cost-Effective Blockchain</strong></h3>



<p>It is quite expensive to validate transactions on the blockchain. This is mainly because blockchains involve exclusive computer parts that require significant energy to execute mining operations. The good news is that this energy consumption can be lowered with an AI-powered blockchain model. </p>



<p>With an AI-powered blockchain model, organizations can execute transactions faster without having to change their IT infrastructure. Additionally, AI can manage the tasks in blockchain more intelligently. Often, it is difficult for humans to crack codes. However, they can become more efficient at this by using AI. Blockchain miners can increase their efficiency and take their mining skills to the next level with an AI-powered mining algorithm.</p>



<h3>7<strong>.&nbsp;Artificial General Intelligence</strong></h3>



<p>The integration of blockchain with AI can set the stage for the development of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) platform. AGI connects multiple AI systems into a single network to bring the capabilities close to the human&#8217;s. Blockchain can serve as a decentralized secure and trusted backbone of such AI network to allow people control its behavior.</p>



<h2><strong>Concluding Remarks</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The convergence of AI and blockchain is creating a plethora of new opportunities for organizations in various industries. Blockchain is helping to accelerate the adoption of AI in the real world. Additionally, it is ensuring increased accessibility of datasets not just for tech giants, but also for small businesses. AI, on the other hand, is helping improve many aspects of blockchain technology. In short, there are huge benefits of integrating AI and blockchain and expanding on their different capabilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The current business environment is changing rapidly. Global commerce, the internet of things (IoT), and mobile apps all contribute to massive amounts of data that need to be stored, managed, devoured, and analyzed for new opportunities. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the existing servers, drives and networking components in many organizations today are too old, laggard and rigid to meet the demands of a modern data center. Additionally, the lack of modern security technologies in outdated infrastructure makes it difficult for IT to manage and secure resources. Most worrying of all is the need for more frequent updates and patches. The high likelihood of failure in outdated infrastructure makes maintenance costlier. This necessitates the purchase of newer, more robust devices. All of this leads to higher operational expenditure (OPEx).</p>



<p>For the above reasons, it is critical to upgrade infrastructure components in a data center to improve its efficiency and performance, while decreasing its Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). There are three infrastructure components to upgrade in a data center—servers, storage, and networking. These upgrades aim to meet the changing needs of your business while increasing performing and efficiency and lowering the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).</p>



<p>Two upcoming technologies that aim to meet data center’s server, storage, and networking needs while giving a lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) are artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. The ways AI and Blockchain can help increase efficiency and decrease TCO for a data center are discussed in the following sections.</p>



<h2>AI in Data Center—How Artificial Intelligence Can Increase Efficiency and Decrease TCO for a Data Center</h2>



<p><br>Much of the technology conversation today centers around artificial intelligence (AI). First defined at the 1956 <a href="https://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_ai.htm">Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence (AI) conference</a>, the concept of AI was originally introduced to build machines that could replicate human learning and intelligence. However, AI has evolved since then to become a broad term that can refer to one of the following things:</p>



<p><strong>Machine Learning</strong>—This ability of machines to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.</p>



<p><strong>Neural Networks</strong>—A network of simple elements called artificial neurons that process information in a way similar to the human brain.</p>



<p><strong>Deep Learning</strong>—A machine learning methodology that teaches computers to ‘learn by example’.</p>



<p>Progress in machine learning and deep learning can be credited for most of the recent revolutionary development in artificial intelligence (AI). Today, there are many practical and wide-ranging uses of AI, with the use of AI in data centers being one of them. More and more organizations today are looking to leverage the AI technology in their data centers to improve efficiency and performance while lowering costs. Following are some ways AI can help increase efficiency and decrease TCO for a data center.</p>



<h3>1. Energy Efficiency</h3>



<p>A good amount of energy is consumed by data centers. While a lot has already been done to control energy use in data centers, a lot more remain to be done for improving energy efficiency while meeting the ever-increasing need of organizations for computing power. One company that has been focused on lowering energy usage in its data centers is Google.</p>



<p><br>Not only has Google built super-efficient servers for its data centers, but it has also found ways to keep these data centers cool without having to pay high costs. Using DeepMind’s deep learning technology, Google has managed to reduce its <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-40/">data center cooling costs by 40%</a>. DeepMind technology can have the same result for any other large-scale energy-consuming environment. Hence, it is being considered by many businesses today to improve their data center energy efficiency through AI deployment.</p>



<h3>2. Server Optimization</h3>



<p>The potential to improve energy efficiency in a data center with AI deployment proves the viability of AI implementation in data centers. Another opportunity that AI can enable in the data center is optimizing server storage systems. With server optimization through AI, an organization can improve processing times, minimize risk factors, and support predictive analytics to identify potential problem areas. For optimized performance, deep learning and machine learning tools in data center can be fed with anything that produces data, making it easier to manage and predict data center loads.</p>



<h3>3. Capacity Planning</h3>



<p>With data centers, you need to be as accurate as possible. This means knowing the number of servers you require, the amount of cooling you need, and the amount of power required. All of this is part of capacity planning—a critical process for organizations building new data centers. With machine learning—an application of AI—you can forecast demand to ensure that you accurately meet the requirements for power, space, IT resources, and cooling. Not only will this keep your data center efficient and performing up to expectations, but it will also help you to decrease your data center’s TCO.</p>



<h3>4. Risk Analysis</h3>



<p>A critical use of AI—or machine learning to be specific—in the data center is risk analysis. The reason for this is that risk analysis using machine learning can help an organization to spot irregularities and prevent downtime in a data center. Other benefits of risk analysis using machine learning in a data center are improved cybersecurity and improved resiliency due to the ability to model different data center configurations. It also facilitates predictive maintenance which eliminates the need to perform maintenance at regularly scheduled intervals.</p>



<h3>5. Security and Maintenance</h3>



<p> With AI, it is possible to automate security and maintenance tasks in a data center in the future. Today, the data center staff has manually secure servers when the security of a data center is breached. Other tasks performed manually in a data center include maintenance work such as getting rid of malfunctioning storage devices or servers. Data centers can become self-reliant for a lot of these tasks if AI-enabled robotics are thrown into the mix. By guiding robots to perform the maintenance work, AI can ensure higher quality of service (QoS) at any data center while keeping the operational costs low.</p>



<h3>6. Collaboration with Robotic Automation</h3>



<p>With AI-enabled robotic technologies, organizations can derive insights to not only modify workflows or improve performance in their data centers, but also modernize their physical infrastructure. By applying both AI and robotic automation, organizations can significantly reduce human involvement in their data centers. AI-enabled robotic automation hardware can be deployed in data centers to allow these centers to efficiently respond to requests, analyze them and make any adjustments required.</p>



<p><br>As seen above, AI can help to create more efficient, cost-effective, and secure data centers. Another technology with the potential to do the same is blockchain. In the next section, we discuss the impact of blockchain on the efficiency and TCO of data centers.</p>



<h2>The Impact of Blockchain on the Efficiency and TCO of Data Centers</h2>



<p>A technology that has the potential to transform data centers is blockchain. Today, there are a large number of users looking to retrieve data in real time. This is requirement that traditional data centers find incredibly hard to fulfill and keep up with. With the dramatic increase in the use of big data, the pressure on data center to accommodate more users by increasing their data transmission speed has also increased.</p>



<p><br>To meet the above requirement, many organizations are changing the primary function of their data centers from storage to real-time data analysis on demand. As a result, blockchain is becoming an increasingly attractive option for use in data centers. The power needs of blockchain are driven by mining. This divides the blockchain costs between energy costs, paying for the server compute, and renting the server space, with energy costs taking up most of the variable costs. Following are some of the ways blockchain can impact the efficiency and TCO of data centers.</p>



<h3>1. Infrastructure to Support the Required Traffic</h3>



<p>Modern data centers need to have a network architecture that is efficient enough to handle the spikes in traffic that they often experience. Once data centers have the infrastructure to support the required traffic, they will be able to secure their data more effectively. A solution that is becoming increasing popular for this purpose is blockchain. </p>



<p><br>Using cryptographic methods, blockchains can distribute data across multiple servers. This makes hacking them difficult. While they were originally designed for the financial sector—cryptocurrencies to be specific—blockchains are now being used in other areas for data security purposes. The first to adopt blockchains as a security measure were data centers that store sensitive data.</p>



<h3>2. Increased Data Center Applications</h3>



<p> Implementing asset management, cooling, virtualization, and capacity planning on the blockchain is possible for data centers with smart contracts. The outcome of this is time and cost savings. In the future, organizations with data centers can look forward to even more blockchain-based applications.</p>



<h3>3. Enabling Data Center Architecture of the Future</h3>



<p> Cloud computing—a technology enabling virtualized data centers—is currently centralized. However, in the future, the cloud could be present in parts that are spread all around the world. In fact, this technology is already being developed by researchers using blockchain. This means that the blockchain technology could bring fundamental changes to data center architecture of the future.</p>



<h3>4. Meeting Future Demands of the Data Center</h3>



<p>The growing number of connected devices and the proliferation of 5G networks means that data centers will need to have an infrastructure in the future that can support a large number of devices with internet connectivity. Additionally, the infrastructure should be able fulfill the demands of increased traffic and secure storage during this process. Blockchain will not only help data centers to meet these demands, but it will also allow them to improve the security of their data storage.</p>



<h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>



<p>As technology and the requirements of data centers continue to evolve, no one has all the answers yet on how to enable increase efficiency and performance and lowered Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) in a data center. However, disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain offer a potential solution to organizations that are looking to have a positive impact on the efficiency and TCO of their data center.<br></p>



<p> At Achievion, we can build AI software and apps as well as blockchain platforms that can help organizations to increase efficiency of their data centers while reducing the costs needed to keep them running.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To most people or the common man, the process of getting food is rather simple. If you want food, you go to the grocery store and pick up the items to cook or eat, or you simply go to a restaurant and order the meal you want. However, the reality is that the food supply system is far more complicated.</p>
<p>In the U.S, each one of us has an interaction with the food industry in one way or the other, which makes it an integral part of the country’s health and economy. The problem is that the complex nature of the food supply system gives rise to several challenges, with food safety being on top of that list. One of the most important aspects of a food business, proper food safety can be ensured with the right technology and training to protect the consumers’ health.</p>
<p>Everything needs to be right when it comes to food safety. One mistake and there could be an outbreak of food-borne illness. Although there is no ‘surefire’ solution to food safety yet, several technologies have exhibited great potential to solve one of the biggest challenges facing the food industry today. A technology that has been in the news more than the others for its impact on food safety is blockchain. Here, we discuss the current challenges in the food safety and how the blockchain technology can help overcome it.</p>
<h2><strong><b>The Current Challenges in Food Safety</b></strong></h2>
<p>Often, the food we depend on for survival and good health are contaminated with germs that can cause sickness or even death. Every few years, new challenges arise in food safety due to changes in food production and supply, changes in the environment that lead to food contamination, changes in tests that diagnose food-borne illnesses, and other reasons. Following are the key challenges in food safety faced by the food industry today:</p>
<h3><b>1. </b><strong><b>Food Always Carries a Certain Level of Risk</b></strong></h3>
<p>With local, state, federal and even international regulations governing the manufacturing and distribution of food, the food industry is among the world’s most heavily-regulated industries. But, even that does not prevent food-related incidents from occurring each year, and they number in the thousands.</p>
<p>Food always carries a certain level of risk. Whenever you consume food, there is a risk that you can fall sick due to the food contents being contaminated and this is proven by the statistics regarding the number of people in the U.S that fall sick each year. Over <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/foodborne-germs.html"><u>45 million people</u></a> in the U.S contact a food-borne illness annually. More than a 120,000 of these get hospitalized and about three thousand die due the severity of their illness.</p>
<p>The above numbers make it critical for the food industry to take all the measures possible to minimize the exposure of consumers to the contaminants in food, which in turn will help alleviate the constant risk carried by the food.</p>
<h3><b>2. </b><strong><b>Complex Supply Chains</b></strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the food supply system is incredibly complex. This can make it difficult for stakeholders to respond quickly to a challenge in food safety. For example, if an outbreak of a foodborne illness was specifically linked to tomatoes, it would become critical to determine where the contamination originated so that the situation can be rectified.</p>
<p>The problem is that the food supply chain comprises of many stages and the contamination could have originated at any of them. The outbreak could have originated during shipping, at the warehouse or handling facility, where the plant was grown, or at another point in the food supply chain. Unless there is a system in place to track the food at every point in the supply chain, determining the source of the contamination can be difficult, if not impossible. And, when you consider that processed food product consists of multiple ingredients, the challenge of tracing food contamination seems even tougher.</p>
<h3><b>3. </b><strong><b>Natural Disasters</b></strong></h3>
<p>From Hurricane Harvey to Irma and more, the U.S coast has experienced many natural disasters in the past few years that has left life of the common man disrupted. A major challenge following these natural disasters has been food safety management. If a Hurricane Harvey like disaster was to occur again, then it would take a food process operation in the vicinity several weeks or even months to bring the facility back on line.</p>
<p>With the current processes in place, not only will be the production of food be suspended after the disaster, but questions will also be raised about the safety of previously processed food and food ingredients in the supply chain. A comprehensive food safety assessment may be needed to ensure the food and food ingredients are free of contamination, which could be expensive and time-consuming.</p>
<h3><b>4. </b><strong><b>Validation</b></strong></h3>
<p>Validation confirms with a certain degree of confidence the effectiveness of a food safety plan’s preventive control measure in alleviating the food safety hazard that has been identified to an acceptable level. Since it is a relatively new concept for the food industry, validation is causing a bit of a confusion for food safety specialists as well as regulatory operatives.</p>
<h2><strong><b>How Blockchain Technology Can Improve Food Safety</b></strong></h2>
<p>A breakthrough technology for food safety, blockchain can improve food safety in several different ways and following are some of them.</p>
<h3><b>1. </b><strong><b>Traceability</b></strong></h3>
<p>An open blockchain can provide every detail in a product’s lifecycle. The blockchain technology makes it possible for anyone with a computer to keep track of a product’s entire supply chain in seconds rather than the hours, days, and weeks it previously took to do the same.</p>
<h3><b>2. </b><strong><b>Full Disclosure</b></strong></h3>
<p>For several reasons, food processers, except for some producers, are reluctant to fully disclose the details pertaining to products. As the technology develops, blockchain could provide retailers, producers, and processers protocols that they are comfortable using and which encourages them to provide effective and complete supply chain traceability.</p>
<h3><b>3. </b><strong><b>Streamlined Supply Chain</b></strong></h3>
<p>Blockchain eliminates intermediaries by connecting the seller directly to the buyer, which, in theory at least, streamlines the supply chain and lowers cost.</p>
<h3><b>4. </b><strong><b>Waste Reduction</b></strong></h3>
<p>Walmart—the multinational retail giant, is working on developing blockchain technology that the company believes could help it to better track product expiry dates and thus reduce waste in stores. It could also help reduce the products that are often needlessly destroyed in recalls.</p>
<h2><strong><b>How Walmart, IBM, and Nestle are Working Towards a Blockchain-Based Food Safety Solution</b></strong></h2>
<p>Nestle, along with Walmart and eight other big-named companies, are<a href="https://disruptive.asia/ibm-blockchain-trial-food-supply-chains/"><u> partnering</u></a> with IBM to implement a blockchain-based food safety solution. The initiative looks to enable the blockchain technology for tracking the entire food supply chain. Launched in the 2017, the initiative is called IBM Food Trust partnership and it looks to use IBM’s blockchain platform to allow companies to ensure traceability throughout the value chain. This could be a massive step towards overcoming many of the challenges in food safety faced today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A disruptive technology, Blockchain can help luxury retailers to lower their costs. It can do this by recording any sort of data, minimizing paperwork, and speeding up transactions. But, that’s not all. Blockchain also enables the fashion industry to immediately verify the source of materials and where items are produced.</p>
<p>With blockchain technology, managing supply chains becomes much easier and more seamless for luxury retailers. Luxury goods can be easily verified for authenticity and retailers no longer suffer losses, alterations, or destruction of supplier records. Additionally, blockchain reduces the chances of fraud and counterfeiting. Tracking products and preventing counterfeiting are two popular reasons for the adoption of blockchain in the retail industry. In fact, these two reasons are why <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/alibaba-fake-food-blockchain-pilot"><u>Alibaba</u></a>—the Chinese e-commerce giant, is an early adopter of blockchain technology.</p>
<h2><strong><b>The Key Benefits of the Blockchain Technology for the Retail Industry</b></strong></h2>
<p>As of 2017, the value of the global luxury goods market was approximately <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/luxury-goods-worldwide-market-study-fall-winter-2017/"><u>$1.36 billion</u></a>. The market includes a variety of items including clothing apparel, old school electronics, jewelry, artwork, and even alcohol dating back a few decades or centuries. While the luxury goods market is doing pretty well in terms of numbers, it needs a trusted, verifiable system for goods that can better track a brand’s Lifecyle or a particular item. Blockchain fits the bill perfectly</p>
<p>Not only will blockchain help prevent many potential counterfeiting issues, it will also ensure more transparent transactions and relationships between buyers and sellers. Following are some of the key benefits of the blockchain technology for the retail industry, which includes luxury retailers.</p>
<h3><b>1. </b><strong><b>Accuracy</b></strong></h3>
<p>By providing a chronological product story, blockchain allows customers to see data and information from every supply chain point. From example, if a retail outlet was selling branded clothing, then blockchain would provide data that shows where, when and by who the clothing was made, as well as the individual materials used to produce the clothing. This allows fashion retailers to ensure that the clothing they are selling are made of materials that are ethically sourced and are of the desired quality.</p>
<p>A new level of trust is assed to the retailer-customer relationship by this increased transparency between the two parties enabled by blockchain. An Israeli company <a href="https://www.gtreview.com/news/fintech/wave-kicks-off-live-blockchain-pilots-for-paperless-trade-solution/"><u>Wave</u></a> is already offering retailers and brands blockchain technology that makes it easier for them to track their supply chain.</p>
<h3><b>2. </b><strong><b>Authenticity</b></strong></h3>
<p>Since it tracks items from the time they are sourced to when they are purchased by the customer, the blockchain technology can solve the authenticity problem for retailers by guaranteeing and confirming to customers that the item they are buying is genuine. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/babyghost-and-vechain-fashion-on-the-blockchain-1476807653/"><u>Babyghost</u></a>—a luxury fashion brand, has partnered with BitSE—a Chinese blockchain company, to deliver clothes with near field communication (NFC) tags. The tags will allow Babyghost to use blockchain technology to verify the clothing at every touchpoint.</p>
<h3><b>3. </b><strong><b>Logistics</b></strong></h3>
<p>Blockchain can make tracking shipments a lot easier by providing information about each logistical step of a product’s journey. With blockchain, you can know in real-time who handled the product, where and when. This results in fewer lost and damaged goods.</p>
<h3><b>4. </b><strong><b>Payments and E-commerce</b></strong></h3>
<p>Not only can blockchain make tracking transaction easier, but it can also create digital records that help streamline the returns and refunds process. Additionally, the technology reduces the resale of stolen goods by allowing the tracking and verification of the purchased goods/items.</p>
<h3><b>5. </b><strong><b>Proof of Ownership</b></strong></h3>
<p>For many retailers, a key benefit of the blockchain technology is the proof of ownership it provides. With blockchain, retailers can prove who made, owned, or had contact with certain goods. This will help to increase the value of the goods and ensure buyers know exactly what they are buying.</p>
<h2><strong><b>How Blockchain will Impact Luxury Retailers</b></strong></h2>
<p>Proof of ownership is of great importance in the luxury goods market and as such, the usefulness of blockchain for luxury retailers can no longer be ignored.  Several luxury brands are already using the blockchain technology for various reasons and Forbes list the use of blockchain as one of the <a href="#55cf609b194d"><u>luxury trends</u></a> to watch out for in 2018.Following are some of the ways blockchain will impact luxury retailers across the globe.</p>
<h3><b>1. </b><strong><b>No More Counterfeiting</b></strong></h3>
<p>The e-commerce industry has grown rapidly over the past decade which has significantly increased the rates of counterfeiting and piracy that the global economy must deal with. The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) estimates that counterfeit products may cost the global economy up to <a href="https://www.oecd.org/sti/ind/2090589.pdf"><u>$250 billion a year</u></a>.</p>
<p>It is much easier to duplicate a picture of a product than duplicating the actual product and counterfeiters have taken full advantage of this. The recent rise in the rates of rates of counterfeiting and piracy has adversely affected luxury retailers. One of the biggest issues in the luxury goods market today, counterfeiting is typically dealt with by deploying technologies such as barcode/QR code, watermarks, hologram, and serial number, or using special ink/dyes/ label etc. Unfortunately, these measures are not effective in the long run.</p>
<p>The good news is that luxury retailers can solve many of their counterfeiting issues by integrating existing technologies such as barcode, RFID, NFC etc. with a blockchain platform to improve the level of security. The entire lifecycle of a product can be monitored and tracked using blockchain’s decentralized and tamper-proof digital ledger. This means that virtually every luxury items can be authenticated using blockchain. The level of transparent provided by blockchain makes it almost impossible for counterfeiters to mimic your luxury items, which can only be a good thing.</p>
<h3><b>2. </b><strong><b>Security and Transparency in the Supply Chain</b></strong></h3>
<p>With blockchain, it becomes much easier for luxury retailers to track individual products, including materials, as they move along the supply chain from supplier to customer. As mentioned before, blockchain provides a chronological product story to allow customers to see data and information from every point in the supply chain. This increase the transparency of transactions and adds trust to the relationship between the retailers and their customers.</p>
<h3><b>3. </b><strong><b>Exchange Goods Transaction</b></strong></h3>
<p>Since it is a distributed ledger, blockchain can provide reliable information about ownership. Without any support from a third-party, blockchain enables a quicker and more efficient process of identity verification. Within the blockchain, it is possible for each user to monitor their personal data closely and securely. The change ownership log of the goods is also clearly visible to them.</p>
<h3><b>4. </b><strong><b>Increased Value of Goods in the Long Term</b></strong></h3>
<p>As more and more luxury retailers adopt and implement the blockchain technology over time, the number of counterfeiters will also gradually decrease.Since counterfeit products will be eliminated from the market, blockchain will help reinforce the concept of valuing products based on quality and scarcity. The only luxury goods that will remain will be those distributed by the brands or their authorized dealers. And, the best thing about all this is that luxury retailers can save a huge amount of time, money, and resources that they would have otherwise allocated to preventing counterfeiting and piracy of their products/goods.</p>
<h2><strong><b>Final Word</b></strong></h2>
<p>At Achievion, we can leverage blockchain technology to build sophisticated mobile and web applications, which includes blockchain solutions for luxury retailers.  Get in touch to know more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2017, there were an estimated <a href="https://www.imeche.org/news/news-article/smart-world-lockdown-preparing-for-a-truly-connected-world"><u>8.4 billion internet-enabled devices</u></a> in the world. By 2030, this could increase to <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/internet-of-things/overview.html"><u>500 billion or more</u></a>. Since all of these devices will be functioning ‘online’, they will be vulnerable to a cyberattack and could even suffer from one. This problem is aggravated by the fact that cybercriminal activities have become progressively more multifaceted and hackers are using sophisticated strategies to steal sensitive information such as intellectual property, personal identifiable information, health records, and financial data.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the cybercriminals are using strategies such as DDoS attacks to disrupt a business’s overall operations and advanced ransomware techniques to monetize data access. The good news is that the blockchain technology promises to provide a computing platform without even a single point of failure. It is also resilient to today’s sophisticated cyberattacks.</p>
<p>The outcomes of several decades of research in cryptography and research, blockchain offers a new approach to storing information and performing functions, making it ideal for environments with high security requirements. The IoT ecosystem, which follows a centralized paradigm, is the perfect example of such an environment. IoT ecosystem today identifies and authenticates individual devices using a central server. This provides cybercriminal with the perfect opportunity to use malicious devices to attack other equipment in the IoT ecosystem.</p>
<p>With blockchain technology, it is possible to create peer-to-peer (P2P) and trustless IoT networks, which ensures no centralized, single point of failure and eliminates the need for devices to trust each other. Additionally, using AI technology, blockchain can monitor and predict cyberattacks and enable proactive response to the incoming cyber threats. Put simply, blockchain technology can prove pivotal in detecting and preventing the cyberattacks. How exactly? We discuss this next.</p>
<h2><strong><b>How Blockchain Can Help to Detect and Prevent Cyberattacks</b></strong></h2>
<p>With blockchain technology, you can safeguard your business from data breaches, cyber-attacks, identity theft to ensure your sensitive information and business is private and safe. This is only the start of the blockchain revolution to detect and prevent cyberattacks, things are only going to get bigger and better. Following are some ways blockchain can help to detect and prevent cyberattacks.</p>
<h3><b>1. </b><strong><b>Eliminating Human Factor from Authentication</b></strong></h3>
<p>Using blockchain technologyin their operations, businesses can authenticate users and devices without the requirement of a password. This prevents human intervention from being a potential attack vendor by eliminating it from the process of authentication. Blockchain authenticates users and devices by allowing an organization’s security system to leverage a distributed public key infrastructure. Instead of a password, this provisions each device with a specific SSL certificate. The certificate data is managed on the blockchain, which makes it almost impossible for attackers to utilize fake certificates.</p>
<h3><b>2. </b><strong><b>Decentralized Storage</b></strong></h3>
<p>The design of blockchain is such that there is no central authority or storage location in the chain. Instead, every user in the network plays a role in store some or all the blockchain. Every user in the network is responsible for verifying the data that is shared and/or maintained. This eliminates the possibility of existing data being removed or false data being added to the blockchain network.</p>
<h3><b>3. </b><strong><b>Traceability</b></strong></h3>
<p>Whether it is added to a private or public blockchain, every transaction in the blockchain network is digitally signed and timestamped. This allows businesses to trace back to a period for each transaction and through their public address, find the corresponding party on the blockchain. The blockchain’s audit capability ensures a high level of security and transparency for each transaction in the network. In terms of cybersecurity, this reassures to businesses that their data isn’t tampered with and is authentic.</p>
<h3><b>4. </b><strong><b>DDoS</b></strong></h3>
<p>Currently, the existing Domain Name System is a stumbling block in hampering the attacks that come from a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS). By implementing the blockchain technology, businesses can completely decentralize the Domain Name System (DNS), which will enable distributions of content to many other nodes, making hacking virtually impossible for cyber-attackers.</p>
<h3><b>5. </b><strong><b>Data Manipulation and Fraud</b></strong></h3>
<p>Immutability is one of the key characteristics of the blockchain technology. Together with the network’s decentralized structure, the use of cryptography and sequential hashing in blockchain makes it almost impossible for any person to unilaterally change the ledger’s data. Organizations can use this capability to maintain data integrity as well as detect and prevent any type of tinkering with data.</p>
<h3><b>6. </b><strong><b>Enhanced Risk Management</b></strong></h3>
<p>Fraudulent incidents can be dealt with very effectively by deploying a fraud prevention system that is based on a distributed ledger approach, like in the case of the blockchain network. A distributed ledger system, the blockchain network will keep a record of previous transactions for reference and verification.  With the blockchain technology, organizations can mitigate, or in some cases, eliminate risks posed by current systems.</p>
<p>Advocates of the blockchain technology says that blockchain enhances risk management by ensuring data records that are difficult to alter, which aids the preservation of record and evidence. Another way that blockchain enhances risk management is by improving transparency for all parties.</p>
<h3><b>7. </b><strong><b>A Secure IoT</b></strong></h3>
<p>An unprecedented level of collaboration, coordination, and connectivity for every device in the IoT ecosystem is required to develop solutions for IoT. Not only that, all devices must work together and integrate with all other devices. But, most important of all, they must communicate and interact with connected systems in a secure manner. Unless a new approach to IoT security is used, it can be time-consuming, difficult, and expensive.</p>
<p>Blockchain may well be the silver lining for the IoT ecosystem. With blockchain technology, it is possible to track billions of connected devices, and make it easier to process transactions and coordinate between devices, which can result in significant savings for manufacturers of IoT devices. But, more importantly, it will eliminate single points of failures to ensure a more resilient IoT ecosystem from where devices can run.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Healthcare is not just a ‘big’ industry; it is much bigger than what most people imagine it to be, as it has critical forward and backward links with the entire economy. In 2017, the U.S spending on healthcare was nearly $3.5 trillion, which is equivalent to the entire GDP of Germany—the 4<sup>th</sup> largest economy in the world. Moreover, Reuters predicts U.S healthcare spending to increase by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-spending/u-s-healthcare-spending-to-climb-5-3-percent-in-2018-agency-idUSKCN1FY2ZD"><u>5.3%</u></a> this year.</p>
<p>If you found the above numbers as unexpected, then you will be pleasantly surprised to hear that the global spending on healthcare is expected to increase to <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/global-spending-health-expected-increase-1828-trillion-worldwide-2040-many-countries"><u>$18.28 trillion</u></a> by 2040. This is equivalent to 1/4<sup>th</sup> of the total global GDP in 2017. Anticipating this increased spending on healthcare, governments and healthcare providers are increasingly looking for any new technology that could help them save money while ensuring better patient care going forward. With the potential to improve efficiency and increase financial security in the healthcare sector, blockchain is a technology with important consequences on the industry.</p>
<p>Originally developed to provide a decentralized digital currency called Bitcoin, blockchain can today be used to improve many of the systems that the global economy relies on. Within healthcare, blockchain promises to create more secure healthcare systems and ensure better protection of everything from drug supply chains to electronic medical records (EMR).</p>
<h2><strong><b>Use Cases of Blockchain in Healthcare</b></strong></h2>
<p>The use of blockchain in healthcare is not limited to the security of healthcare systems and the patient health data stored there. Instead, the use of blockchain can help the healthcare industry in a number of ways beyond security. From streamlining payment transactions to creating large transactional databases to verifying contractual agreements and linking numerous disparate pieces of information, the use cases for blockchain in healthcare deserve attention and that is exactly what is going to happen here. Following are some potential use cases for blockchain technology in healthcare:</p>
<h3><b>1. </b><strong><b>Medical Records</b></strong></h3>
<p>There was a time when doctors would pull out from their drawer a dreary looking folder with a visiting patient’s name written on the front. In case a patient visited their doctors quite frequently, they would find the folder loaded with different pieces of paper which made it look scarily full. And, this presented a danger to the patient’s health—what if the doctor gave the patient an injection or medication again because they weren’t sure if the patient had already taken the medicine or not?</p>
<p>The good thing is that these concerns did not escape the sights of policy makers and healthcare providers and with the advent of computing technologies, the healthcare industry started transitioning from dusty old paper records to digitally stored electronic medical records (EMRs). Unfortunately, the EMRs did not quite live up to their promise. For instance, it was <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.24.5.1103"><u>predicted in 2005</u></a> that the adoption of EMRs could potentially save the healthcare industry billions of dollars every year. More than a decade has passed since then and the savings that were promised are yet to materialize.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there has been widespread dissatisfaction with EMRs, mainly because a single oversight or mistake by a doctor could result in casualties. The good news is that blockchain can succeed where other systems have failed, and it can do this by creating a steady and secure medical record that can be accessed by the patient or whoever the patient provides access to. Not only can this eliminate the gaps in medical history, but it could also minimize the time and money spent on gathering copies of records from various providers.</p>
<h3><b>2. </b><strong><b>Data Security</b></strong></h3>
<p>Blockchain is a smart way to restrict access to and protect patient health data as the technology can be used to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing the information.</p>
<h3><b>3. </b><strong><b>Clinical Trial Research</b></strong></h3>
<p>With the blockchain technology, it is possible to streamline clinical trial patient recruitment which currently is an expensive and time-consuming process. This can be achieved by identifying patients who may be eligible for clinical trials by using the demographic, diagnostic, and therapeutic history contained in blockchain data.</p>
<h3><b>4. </b><strong><b>Claims and Billing History</b></strong></h3>
<p>By eliminating the series of validations and intermediaries involved in traditional transactions, blockchain helps to simplify the complex medical billing process. With blockchain, organizing claims processing and billing is easy because the blockchain technology created records that are constant, secure, and trackable. This not only saves time and money, but it also minimizes the risk of billing fraud. Additionally, you can use the blockchain technology to connect multiple claim types.</p>
<h3><b>5. </b><strong><b>Linking Disparate Sources of Health-Related Data</b></strong></h3>
<p>Provided an individual patient can be identified in multiple datasets, blockchain could be used to link medical record and healthcare claims data with the person’s biometric data obtained from various sources.</p>
<h2><strong><b>How Blockchain Can Help Keep Patient Records Secure</b></strong></h2>
<p>As technology advances, healthcare data security is becoming more and more vulnerable. In fact,1 in 4 data breaches occur in the healthcare industry. Additionally, healthcare breaches are estimated to have affected 1 in 13 patients between 2015 and 2019. The good news is that blockchain is promising to provide healthcare with a solution to cybersecurity. An example of this is the blockchain solution for securing electronic health records (EHRs).</p>
<p>While EHRs have provided physicians with a better way to manage the data of their patients by converting paper data into digital records, they are not shared openly between systems. This means that, with EHRs, there’s no single source available where all individual patient health data resides. In such times, we need to have a fresh approach to improve data management and security in the healthcare industry.</p>
<p>The need of the hour is a secure place where the complete medical history and other relevant information of a patient can be systemically stored for future use and analysis. The only technology that can provide this solution is blockchain. The future of data management and security, blockchain decentralizes health care record systems and eliminates the need for a ruling central authority.</p>
<p>With decentralization of health care record systems, authorized individuals have access to the entire health data and history contained in it. Since health data must go through multiple check points for validation instead of a single gateway, this creates an atmosphere of reliability. With the current health care record system,the health data of a patient is submitted to and salvaged from single platform. This platform is unprotected and void of a multi-party validation framework.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the patient is notified of the change and their validation is requested when a health record on the blockchain is altered. The awareness resulting from decentralized validation increases the level of security of patient health data, mainly because of the customizable nature of the blockchain technology. For these reasons and more, the use of blockchain is a great way to secure patient health data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Also known as collaborative consumption, sharing economy is a concept highlighting an individual’s ability or preference to rent or borrow things rather than buy and own them. The concept of the sharing economy has really struck a chord with the consumers and it is expected that the global sharing economy will reach <a href="https://www.lloyds.com/news-and-risk-insight/press-releases/2018/04/sharing-economy"><u>$335 billion by 2025</u></a>, a substantial increase from the $15 billion in 2014.</p>
<p>The original idea behind the internet/technology-based ‘sharing economy’ was to connect communities of peers via the internet to allow them to share several underutilized resources. Perhaps, this is the reason blockchain solutions are being tipped as the next big thing for the sharing economy.</p>
<p>In fact, one could go as far as to say that blockchain is the future of the sharing economy. There’s some solid reasoning behind this statement but we will leave it for later, right after we’ve discussed the evolution and limitations of the sharing economy.</p>
<h2><strong><b>The Evolution and Limitations of the Sharing Economy</b></strong></h2>
<p>One of the fastest growing business trends in history, the sharing economy has seen investments of more than <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2017/strategy-accelerating-growth-consumer-products-hopping-aboard-sharing-economy.aspx"><u>$23 billion into startups</u></a> with a share-based model. While it’s impossible to know the actual size of the sharing economy, there are many sharing platforms or services that provide us with the cues. Major contributors to the sharing economy are Uber and Airbnb—two of the fastest growing companies in the world.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, the two companies had a combined market capitalization of $103 billion, which would have them ranked among the 40 wealthiest countries in the world. Uber is the major contributor here with <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/2/9/16996834/uber-latest-valuation-72-billion-waymo-lawsuit-settlement"><u>$72 billion</u></a> but Airbnb does not fare too badly either with <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/8/8/16113140/top-10-most-valuable-startups-uber-spacex-wework-airbnb"><u>$31 billion</u></a> market cap.The value of these major players is not the only indicator of the worth of the sharing economy.</p>
<p>In 2016, the sharing economy in the U.S had a consumer base of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/289856/number-sharing-economy-users-us/"><u>44.8 million adults</u></a>. This is expected to grow to 86.5 million users by 2021. Additionally, <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/employment-and-growth/independent-work-choice-necessity-and-the-gig-economy"><u>Mckinsey</u></a> estimates that in the U.S and Europe alone, sharing platforms recruit 20% to 30% of the workforce, which adds up to roughly 162 million people.</p>
<p>The concept of the sharing economy is not new as rural communities in ancient history have thrived using the same idea of ‘bartering’. The only difference is that today internet and mobile technology have made it easier than ever to manage share-based transactions. The sharing economy is an umbrella term that encompasses many systems including:</p>
<ul>
<li>P2P economy</li>
<li>Collaborative consumption</li>
<li>Coworking/cobranding</li>
<li>Crowdfunding/crowdsourcing</li>
<li>Freelancing</li>
</ul>
<p>The internet/technology-based sharing economy has disrupted many traditional business sectors including transportation, consumer goods, professional and personal services, and healthcare. While the internet/technology-based sharing economy has the potential to disrupt many more traditional business sectors, many people in China, U.S, and Europe remain skeptical about it.</p>
<p>The skepticism is due to the limitations of the sharing economy. One of the biggest limitations of the sharing platforms is that they rarely allow users to connect with one another outside of the platform. The sole purpose of this is to protect corporate interests—the company gets its transaction fees for as long as it keeps users within a proprietary ecosystem.</p>
<p>While this model helps protect the data and identity of the users, it doesn’t create an environment of trust that is critical for building global sharing communities. For example, while the company may claim otherwise, AirBnb does not allow a true peer-to-peer relationship on its platform as it hides the contact details of the people transacting on its network, thus preventing users from contacting outside of the platform.</p>
<p>Not many companies in the sharing economy realize this, but unifying sharing platforms into a single ecosystem would provide users with a convenient solution, thus increasing the likelihood of the mass adoption of the sharing economy. Blockchain can help overcome the above limitations to the trigger mass adoption of the sharing economy.</p>
<h2><strong><b>Why Blockchain is the Future of the Sharing Economy</b></strong></h2>
<p>The decentralized nature of blockchain networks makes it possible for sharing providers to connect more directly with users in a true peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion. Not only that, blockchain can also energize and unlock the sharing economy by making it cheaper to create and operate an online platform. For example, transactions could be automatically executed using smart contracts or performed at lower cost by other small competing providers.</p>
<p>Not only does blockchain provide an extra layer of security that has not been possible until now, the decentralized nature of the technology also helps reduce the cost of sharing. Currently those using sharing platforms such as AirBnb, Uber and others have to pay a transaction fee to these platforms. By eliminating the middlemen from the sharing economy, blockchain will allow users of the economy to avoid the above fees, thus helping them save money.</p>
<h2><strong><b>Companies that are Integrating Blockchain into the Sharing Economy</b></strong></h2>
<p>Internet-based sharing platforms have already disrupted the sharing economy. However, the future of the sharing economy is blockchain-based and following are some companies looking to make an impact on daily consumer life with blockchain-based sharing:</p>
<h3><strong><b>ShareRing</b></strong></h3>
<p>One company that has uncovered all the benefits of a blockchain-sharing economy integration is <a href="https://sharering.network/en"><u>ShareRing</u></a>. The company believes that integrating blockchain into the sharing economy would create a unique platform that could revolutionize the way goods and services are shared.</p>
<p>The idea behind ShareRing is to create a blockchain which will allow a dual-coin mechanism. The name given to the network is ShareLedger.  The network will be driven by a utility token called ShareToken (SHR) which will be tradable on cryptocurrency exchanges.  SharePay (SHRP) will be directly exchangeable for fiat and used as a payment currency for daily transactions on the ShareRing platform. There are several benefits of this including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liming exposure to price volatility risks associated with the utility token</li>
<li>More accessible network for everyday users wanting to buy sharing services with fiat currency</li>
<li>Bypassing foreign exchange fees imposed by banks and credit-card companies in cross-border transactions</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><b>Bee Token</b></strong></h3>
<p>An emerging crypto home-sharing solution, <a href="https://www.beetoken.com/"><u>Bee Token</u></a> is a decentralized network that is powered by cryptocurrency and runs on the blockchain. The purpose of this is to increase the security, accountability, and safety of direct exchanges between home providers and renters.</p>
<h3><strong><b>Origin </b></strong></h3>
<p>A blockchain-based organization, <a href="https://www.originprotocol.com/en"><u>Origin</u></a> aims to take decentralized sharing to the next level. The company wants to be the foundation for P2P marketplaces. To create an environment for smart contracts, where buyers and sellers perform transactions without any central authority, the company is building decentralized markets on the Origin protocol. The hope is that this protocol would allow organizations to build new marketplaces without the burden of the red tape and overhead fees that rule existing shared economy marketplaces.</p>
<h2><strong><b>Final Word</b></strong></h2>
<p>The internet has given rise to the sharing economy and today people are more willing to transact with one another. However, a stumbling block in the mass adoption of this practice are intermediaries, who, until recently, have controlled all interactions and transactions among people. The good news is that blockchain solutions are being built to remove the middlemen from the sharing economy and build true peer-to-peer marketplaces. However, this would increase the responsibility on technology providers such as Achievion to leverage the blockchain technology to build sophisticated mobile and web applications.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As private companies adopt blockchain, it also offers the promise of a more accessible, more transparent and efficient government. With blockchain technology, governments can simplify the management of trusted information and make it easier for agencies to gain access to critical information while still maintaining security.</p>
<p>So far, Eastern European governments have led the way in blockchain for government, most notably Estonia&#8217;s, which implemented blockchain in 2012 across its healthcare, judiciary, legislature and security registries. Many countries now have their own projects underway and, if successful, could have a major global impact.</p>
<p>As government blockchain adoption grows, blockchain is transforming regulatory compliance. Here are the ways in which blockchain is impacting government policies around the world.</p>
<h2>Improving Financial Regulatory Compliance</h2>
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-money Laundering) requirements have become the primarily means of allowing the government to monitor customer interactions with financial institutions. However, they have become very time consuming and costly for both customers and financial entities.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/6-trends-aml-compliance/">industry statistics</a> peg the false-positive rate for suspicious activity alerts at between 75% and 90%. In addition, the 2016 Dow Jones and Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS) Global Anti-Money Laundering Survey found that 55% of alerts take over 5 minutes to close, 30% take longer than 30 minutes, and 10% take more than an hour.</p>
<p>The transparent nature of blockchain will permit financial institutions and government regulatory agencies to communicate directly with each other on the same network. As a result, blockchain makes for a far more efficient compliance environment versus the current model where identifying violations take longer and must involve a third-party.</p>
<p>Already the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-unveils-enabling-framework-for-blockchain-and-fintech-wants-to-be-global-hub">European Banking Authority</a> are doing research into the technology. With the development of government backed, blockchain-based registries, greater compliance can be achieved. This will allow financial institutions to identify suspicious activity faster and with greater accuracy so that governments can act on financial crimes more rapidly.</p>
<p>In addition, blockchain fundamentally transforms the way in which financial companies and businesses in other industries interact with the government. Rather than asking companies to comply with the law where the highest level of compliance depends on the company&#8217;s ability to cover the costs, blockchain will create a level playing field for businesses of all sizes.</p>
<h2>Social Services Data Sharing: Consent and Privacy</h2>
<p>Government social services are one major area that could be positively impacted by the implementation of blockchain. That is because the delivery of social services generally consists of a network of both government and private partners.</p>
<p>In addition, information shared across partners is often highly sensitive (e.g. personal identification documents, medical records, case information). With a complex network of parties that may have conflicting or even competing interests, there is a tendency not to readily share data and expertise.</p>
<p>In most cases, providers have little to no visibility into how these services are received by individuals. As a result, issues such as data sensitivities, costs, and regulatory restrictions have plagued governments to the point of limiting the government&#8217;s ability to serve the public effectively, especially in times of crisis.</p>
<p>One major challenge of data sharing has been ensuring that all partners comply with privacy and individual consent laws. With blockchain, governments can establish greater trust by implementing smart contracts that adhere to regulatory statutes. The smart contracts control how and when consent is applied.</p>
<h2>Government Blockchain Adoption Begins With Improving Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>As the default repository for the sensitive data of its citizens, governments have increasingly become prime targets for hackers. However, instead of accepting these attacks as a sign of the digital era, governments are finding ways to mitigate these risk by deploying blockchain solutions.</p>
<p>While governments may be slow to adopt blockchain as a result of concerns about what will happen when something goes wrong, testing blockchain in real environments will help to drive quality applications.</p>
<p>Already the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has funded blockchain startups who are focused on research and development. In June, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2018/06/15/news-release-dhs-awards-austin-based-factom-inc-192k">DHS awarded</a> the Austin-based startup Factom a grant to help advance the security of digital identity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as surveillance cameras and sensors.</p>
<p>The initiatives are a part of the government’s push to achieve the highest levels of cybersecurity as a result of the passage of the <a href="https://www.blackstratus.com/compliance/fisma/">Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)</a>. With blockchain, the government can improve security by eliminating the single-point-of-failure risk, which can help make a breach virtually impossible.</p>
<p>The project, entitled &#8220;Blockchain Software to Prove Integrity of Captured Data From Border Devices&#8221; will focus on authenticating device identity to prevent spoofing, and ensure the integrity of data captured from those devices.</p>
<h2>Solving Government Challenges With Blockchain</h2>
<p>Some of the most pressing problems that governments around the world face are essentially problems of scale. This is why blockchain is expected to play a major role in the ability of governments to modernize their services in the coming years.</p>
<p>Although we are still in the the beginning stages of governments understanding and exploring this technology, many are recognizing its potential and are starting to explore applications that address the challenges of sharing data. Given the vast number of potential applications for blockchain, there is a good possibility that governments and governance will become significantly more decentralized in the future.</p>
<p>At Achievion, our blockchain architects are experienced in designing and developing solutions for both private and government sector entities. As blockchain technology evolves, our team can guide you in uncovering new opportunities for improving your departmental operations with blockchain and help you to determine how to best implement your vision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology is rapidly becoming a must-have future-proofing strategy for businesses in many industries. It has the potential to become a game-changer for any business where security and trust come at a premium. The world’s top companies, including IBM, Google, and Goldman Sachs, already recognize that the technology could become a differentiating factor that creates significant competitive advantage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the potential of blockchain is vast, so is the uncertainty. Blockchain is so new and complex that it can be difficult to determine how to implement it effectively. Instead of simply forging ahead, businesses should proceed deliberately with careful strategic planning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you develop your blockchain strategy, consider these 7 strategic planning considerations.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Understand Blockchain&#8217;s Use Cases</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful blockchain strategy doesn’t occur in a vacuum. Instead, companies need to understand that their industry expertise and capabilities influence the decision to pursue a specific blockchain use case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey has identified </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/blockchain-beyond-the-hype-what-is-the-strategic-business-value"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 distinct use cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for blockchain that address two critical needs:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Record Keeping</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><b> Static registry.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The blockchain serves as a distributed database for the purpose of storing reference data.</span></li>
<li><b> Identity.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The blockchain is used as a distributed database of identity-related information.</span></li>
<li><b> Smart contracts.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are a set of conditions recorded to the blockchain such that automated, self-executing actions are triggered when the predefined conditions are met.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transactions</span></h3>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> Dynamic registry. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain serves as a dynamic distributed database that continuously updates as assets are exchanged via a digital platform.</span></li>
<li><b> Payments infrastructure. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain is updated as cash or cryptocurrency payments are made among the blockchain&#8217;s participants.</span></li>
<li><b> Other. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">These use cases are comprised of several of the other use cases or simply do not fit neatly into any of the previous categories.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain can be configured in a number of ways to meet the objectives a particular use cases. As a result, businesses must use strategic planning to uncover the use cases that will deliver the greatest returns. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Engage All Stakeholders</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most strategic planning processes involve obtaining input from the organization&#8217;s key stakeholders. However, blockchain is a technology that requires collaborative effort in order to be effective, not only from the organization’s executives, but from employees at all levels and  third-party stakeholders. That is why it is critical to ensure that all stakeholders are successfully identified and engaged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the strategic plan should also involve establishing a blockchain governance model. Blockchain governance is not only about who controls the blockchain, but it also establishes resolution mechanisms in the event of an anomaly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any company that seeks to benefit from blockchain&#8217;s potential should also consider joining or forming a blockchain consortium. According to </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/signals-for-strategists/emergence-of-blockchain-consortia.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, more than 40 consortia have been formed globally. In addition, among executives who are knowledgeable about blockchain, 18% already participate in a consortium, while 45% say they are likely to join one and 14% are considering forming one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining consortia allows businesses to learn about blockchain trends, keep tabs on what competitors are doing, defend against new threats, and better prepare for implementing blockchain technology. Furthermore, achieving results may not even only depend on the company&#8217;s initial buy-in, but also in developing strategic alliances with the other industry players.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Hire Outside Consultants</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain consultants can provide advice on the strategic implementation of blockchain technology based on research and cutting-edge analysis. With access to in-depth knowledge of blockchain technology, businesses benefit from working with experts who have practical, real-world experience with blockchain implementation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring outside blockchain consultants can significantly reduce the likelihood of failure of your project, increase speed to market, and deliver cost savings. These results would simply be impossible to achieve otherwise given the fierce competition for blockchain talent and inability of most companies to attract it. In addition, blockchain consultants not only understand blockchain’s architecture, they also understand its scalability potential which will be required to help you achieve your long-term business goals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Plan for Short-term Returns</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many companies see blockchain as a long-term business strategy without any consideration for short-term gains. Given that they often lack the foresight to determine what the ultimate results of a blockchain implementation will be, they risk not seeing a return on investment fast enough to avoid failure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, companies must also consider what blockchain brings to the table over the short-term. In many cases, the answer is cost reduction. With short-term profitability achieved, projects can then be scaled up to deliver more transformative results for the future. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Stay True to Your Vision</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your organization initially decided that it was time to explore implementing blockchain, your reasons for doing so were intended to be statements of the long-term goals of your organization. While changing market conditions may require you to adapt your strategy or refine your approach to implementing blockchain, staying focused on your long-term vision is paramount. If a change in the vision itself is required, make sure to do so with the understanding that blockchain technology itself is evolving.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Conduct Ongoing Strategy Reviews</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key factor impacting the success of your organization&#8217;s blockchain strategy is periodic analysis of implementation results and an ongoing review of your strategic plans. It is important that you regularly review the implementation plan and assess the progress that have been made. When deviations occur, there also need to be mechanisms in place for getting the plan back on track. When challenges arise, it may be necessary to adjust one or more of the objectives of your blockchain strategy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Timing Is Key</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timing is critical if you want to develop an effective blockchain strategy for your business. There are significant new developments that are happening daily in this space. In addition to the developments that are happening in core capabilities at the industry level, there are also advances being made from an academic and regulatory perspective. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, most personal identity information is managed in a centralized manner resulting in a lot of data being shared without users&#8217; explicit consent. Despite the veneer of &#8220;managed data,&#8221; most organizations can&#8217;t even answer basic questions about the data that they manage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, where is all of our information located? Who has permission to use it and for what purposes can it be used? How secure are those companies systems? Who has seen the data? How current is it? No one actually knows, not the individuals who generate the data nor the companies and government that control the databases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems strange when you think about it given the fact that cybersecurity is one of the most pressing concerns for businesses when it comes to risk management. Fortunately, users and companies alike are waking up to the risks of the current model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identity and control over personality data remains at the forefront of organization concerns given the recent passage of the European Union&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. More recently, the role of centralized tech giants as digital identity brokers has come under fire in the wake of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook&#8217;s Cambridge Analytica scandal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many experts believe that blockchain will become the technology that transforms identity management. Here is how blockchain can be used for identity management and a brief look at some of the projects that are currently being implemented.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning Control Over Data Sharing to Individuals</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the current centralized approach to identity verification gives entities far more access to information about individuals than they need. This creates opportunities for identity theft and other fraud-related consequences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain can be used for creating and managing digital IDs that are stored on a decentralized computer system. In contrast to the current centralized model, blockchain-based identity management can be used for authentication purposes across countries. Most importantly, it allows users to decide which companies they want to share their personal data with and specify their own terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of blockchain-based digital IDs, known as self-sovereign identity, will allow individuals to have greater control over their identities while at the same time improving individuals&#8217; interactions with the public and private organizations that need access to their data.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.civic.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a San Francisco-based company that is developing a self-sovereign ID system that utilizes the concept of identity attestation to allow consumers to selectively share information from pre-existing credentials with companies. The identity platform features a mobile app where users can enter their personal information to be stored in an encrypted format.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is currently working on establishing partnerships with governments, banks and other entities that can validate the individual&#8217;s identity information. The benefit of this system is that users will no longer have their identity information collected by many service providers, thus reducing their risk of identity theft. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other projects that are currently underway which focus on allowing users to build their own user-controlled identities, akin to social media profiles, include </span><a href="http://sovrin.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sovrin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://uport.me/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uPort</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government agencies will continue to play a critical role in identity management as they are responsible for serving as the trust verification entities of individuals’ identities. Despite initial resistance by some governments to upgrade their systems, there are many opportunities to improve government identity management systems with blockchain. Additionally, changes are needed as some individuals remain underserved by current systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Microsoft and Accenture are already teaming up in order to build a digital ID network using blockchain as a part of the </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-accenture-digitalid/accenture-microsoft-team-up-on-blockchain-based-digital-id-network-idUSKBN19A22B"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ID2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project supported by the United Nations. The purpose of the project is to provide legal identification to 1.1 billion people worldwide who lack official documents, including refugees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new platform will connect to existing record-keeping systems of commercial and public entities via the blockchain and will allow users to have access to their personal information from anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the Dubai Government is working on a </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/04/blockchain-in-dubai-smart-cities-from-concept-to-reality/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">city-wide blockchain platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in cooperation with IBM and ConsenSys that is designed to streamline ID verification thus reducing business registration wait times. It is also digitizing citizens&#8217; health records, contracts, and wills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estonia is already using a state-sponsored blockchain for its </span><a href="https://e-resident.gov.ee/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">e-Estonia program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allows citizens to make online tax payments, manage their digital IDs, participate in i-voting and access electronic health records. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud Prevention</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centralized sources that contain sensitive data have become a goldmine for hackers. In fact, only 16% of banks reported that they can detect fraud as it is being attempted, according a </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=XB&amp;infotype=PM&amp;htmlfid=GBE03726USEN&amp;attachment=GBE03726USEN.PDF&amp;cm_mmc=OSocial_Blog-_-Blockchain_Blockchain-_-WW_WW-_-BLOG+Link+in+Text+for+IBV+Report+winning+the+face+off+against+fraud&amp;cm_mmca1=000020YK&amp;cm_mmca2=10005803&amp;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">global study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by the IBM Institute for Business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, there are already several new regulations that have toughened requirements for companies to ensure consumer privacy including the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive#Revised_Directive_on_Payment_Services_(PSD2)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revised Payment Service Directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (PSD2) and GDPR. The European is also currently negotiating the </span><a href="https://www.consultancy.uk/news/13624/the-five-main-impacts-of-5amld-regulation-for-financial-institutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth European Union Anti-Money Laundering Directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (5AMLD), which will likely have a major impact on transactional data sharing for financial institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regulations becoming more difficult than ever to enforce because they must rely on the most diverse data possible, blockchain provides companies with auditable data. In order to improve current fraud prevention measures, credit providers, insurance companies, and banks are investing heavily in blockchain identity-management solutions as a means of speeding up the application process and safeguarding their client&#8217;s data. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing Blockchain Identity Management Projects</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For businesses looking to implement blockchain-based identity management projects, adopting a flexible, easy-to-use, and user-centric model is the best approach.
