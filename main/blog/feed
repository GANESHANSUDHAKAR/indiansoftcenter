					<description><![CDATA[Synthetic datasets, such as synthetic images, can be used for any computer vision task, from instant segmentation to image classification to anomaly detection. Here, we will go through everything there is to know about synthetic data including its importance, how it is created, its benefits, applications, and more.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Synthetic data is annotated information generated by computer simulations or algorithms as a substitute for real-world data. To put it another way, synthetic data is generated in digital worlds instead of being accumulated or measured in the real world.</p>



<p>Although it is artificial, synthetic data statistically or mathematically represents real-world data. According to research, it can be as useful as, if not better than, information based on actual people, events, or objects for training an AI model.</p>



<p>As a result, deep neural network developers are increasingly using synthetic data for training their models. Indeed, according to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11512.pdf"><u>2019 survey</u></a>&nbsp;of the field, the use of synthetic data is &#8220;one of the most exciting general methodologies on the rise in contemporary deep learning, particularly computer vision,&#8221; which relies on unstructured data such as images and video.</p>



<p>Gartner predicted in a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/account/signin?method=initialize&amp;TARGET=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.gartner.com%252Fdocument%252F4002912"><u>June 2021 study</u></a>&nbsp;on synthetic data that by 2030, the majority of the data used in AI would be produced artificially by simulations, guidelines, statistical models, or other methodologies.</p>



<h2><strong>What Is the Importance of Synthetic Data?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Synthetic data is useful because it can be produced to fulfill specific requirements or conditions that are not met by existing (real) data. It can be useful in a variety of situations, including:</p>



<ul><li>When data availability is restricted due to privacy concerns or how it can be used</li><li>Data is required for testing a product before it is released, but such data either does not exist or is not accessible to the testers.</li><li>Machine learning algorithms require training data. However, such data is expensive to produce in real life, particularly in the case of self-driving cars.</li></ul>



<p>Though synthetic data was first used in the 1990s, the enormous amount of storage space and computing power in the 2010s made synthetic data more widely used.</p>



<p>To train neural networks, developers require large, meticulously labeled datasets. In a broad sense, more diverse training data leads to more accurate AI models. The issue is that collecting and labeling datasets with tens of millions to tens of thousands of elements takes time and is often extremely expensive.</p>



<p>Enter Synthetic data. According to Paul Walborsky, co-founder of AI. Reverie, one of the first specialized synthetic data services, a solitary image that could cost <a href="https://aiexpress.io/what-is-synthetic-data-nvidia-blogs/"><u>$6 from a classifying service</u></a>, can be produced artificially for six cents.</p>



<p>Saving money is only the beginning. Synthetic data is critical in dealing with privacy concerns and minimizing bias by guaranteeing data diversity to accurately reflect the real world. Since synthetic datasets are automatically classified and can include rare but critical corner cases, they are sometimes superior to real-world data.</p>



<h2><strong>How Is Synthetic Data Created?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>To understand the creation process of synthetic data, you need to first know the methods used for creating it and the strategies that help to build it.</p>



<h3><strong>Methods for Creating Synthetic Data</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>When deciding on the best method of producing synthetic data, it is critical to first consider the kind of synthetic data you want. There are three main categories to choose from, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.</p>



<h4><em>1.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><u><em>Fully Synthetic</em></u></em></strong><strong><em><u><em></em></u></em></strong></h4>



<p>There is no original data in this data. It implies that re-identification of any single unit is nearly impossible while all variables remain fully available.</p>



<h4><em>2.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><u><em>Partially Synthetic</em></u></em></strong><strong><em><u><em></em></u></em></strong></h4>



<p>Only sensitive data is supplanted with synthetic data. It necessitates a strong reliance on the imputation model. This reduces model dependence, but it does allow for some disclosure due to the true values that persist in the dataset.</p>



<h4><em>3.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><u><em>Hybrid Synthetic</em></u></em></strong><strong><em><u><em></em></u></em></strong></h4>



<p>This data is created by combining real and synthetic data. The fundamental allocation of real data is evaluated, and the closest neighbor of every data point is created while ensuring the correlation and authenticity of other parameters in the dataset.</p>



<p>For every record of the actual data, a comparable record in the simulated data is selected, and these are then merged to produce hybrid data.</p>



<h3><strong>Strategies for Building Synthetic Data</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>When it comes to building synthetic data, one of the following two main strategies is typically used.</p>



<h4><em>1.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><u><em>Drawing Numbers from a Distribution</em></u></em></strong><strong><em><u><em></em></u></em></strong></h4>



<p>This technique works by analyzing real statistical distributions and simulating them with synthetic data. This can include the development of generative models.</p>



<h4><em>2.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><u><em>Agent-Based Modeling</em></u></em></strong><strong><em><u><em></em></u></em></strong></h4>



<p>In this method, a model that describes an observed behavior is formed, and then random data is reproduced using the same model. It stresses comprehending the impacts of agent contacts on a system as a whole.</p>



<h4><em>3.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><u><em>Deep Learning Models</em></u></em></strong><strong><em><u><em></em></u></em></strong></h4>



<p>In addition to the two main strategies, deep learning models are also utilized to build synthetic data. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Variational Autoencoder models are artificial data generation methodologies that enhance data utility by providing more data to models.</p>



<h2><strong>Benefits of Synthetic Data</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The ability to produce data that is similar to the real thing may appear to be an infinite way to create situations for testing and development. While this is true, it is worth remembering that any synthetic models derived from data can only recreate specific properties of the data, which means that they will eventually only be able to recreate general trends.</p>



<p>Having said that, synthetic data has several advantages over real data, including the following.</p>



<h3>1.&nbsp;<strong>Overcoming Real-World Data Usage Constraints</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Real-world data may be subject to usage restrictions as a result of privacy laws or other regulatory requirements. Synthetic data can recreate all-important statistical characteristics of real data without disclosing the real data, thereby addressing the problem.</p>



<h3>2.&nbsp;<strong>Generating Data to Simulate Never-Before-Experienced Conditions</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Synthetic data is the only option when real data is unavailable. With synthetic data, you can simulate or create conditions never experienced before.</p>



<h3>3.&nbsp;<strong>Immunity to Some Common Statistical Challenges</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Synthetic data offers immunity to some common statistical challenges. Skip patterns, item nonresponse, and other logical limitations are examples of these.</p>



<h3>4.&nbsp;<strong>Focuses on Relationships</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Instead of focusing solely on specific statistics, synthetic data looks to maintain multivariate associations between variables.</p>



<p>These advantages show that the creation and use of synthetic data will only increase as our data becomes more complicated and secure.</p>



<h2><strong>Challenges of Synthetic Data</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Though synthetic data has numerous advantages that can help organizations with data science projects, it also has drawbacks. The following are some of them.</p>



<h3>1.&nbsp;<strong>Potentially Missing Outliers</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Synthetic data can only imitate real-world data; it cannot be a replica. As a result, synthetic data may not contain some outliers that exist in original data.</p>



<h3>2.&nbsp;<strong>The Data Source Determines the Quality of the Model</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>The quality of synthetic data is strongly linked with the quality of the source data and the model used to generate the data. The biases in the original dataset may be reflected in synthetic data.</p>



<h3>3.&nbsp;<strong>More Challenging User Acceptance</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Synthetic data is a new concept, and consumers who have not yet witnessed its advantages may not accept it as valid.</p>



<h3>4.&nbsp;<strong>It Takes Time and Effort to Generate Synthetic Data</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Synthetic data, while easier to generate than actual data, is not free. Instead, a lot of time and effort is required to generate it.</p>



<h3>5.&nbsp;<strong>Output Control is Mandatory</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Comparing synthetic data with human-annotated or reliable data is the best way to make sure the output is correct, particularly in complex datasets. This is due to the possibility of discrepancies in synthetic data when attempting to recreate intricacies in original datasets.</p>



<h2><strong>The Role of Synthetic Data in Machine Learning</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The importance of synthetic data in machine learning is rapidly growing. This is because machine learning algorithms are instructed with massive amounts of data, which can be hard to acquire or produce without synthetic data.</p>



<p>It can also play a major role in the development of image recognition algorithms and other tasks that are becoming the foundation of AI. There are several additional advantages to using simulated data to assist in machine learning development:</p>



<ul><li>Once a preliminary synthetic model/environment has been formed, data production becomes easier.</li><li>Classifying accuracy that would be prohibitively expensive or even unobtainable by hand</li><li>The ability of the synthetic environment to be altered as needed to improve the model.</li><li>Usability as a replacement for data containing sensitive information</li></ul>



<p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and self-driving simulations are two synthetic data applications that are gaining popularity in their corresponding machine learning communities.</p>



<p>Learning through real-world experiments is difficult in real life, and it is even more difficult for algorithms. It is especially difficult for people who are hit by self-driving cars, as in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/05/08/uber-self-driving-car-saw-ignored-pedestrian-deadly-arizona/"><u>Uber&#8217;s fatal crash in Arizona</u></a>. While Uber reduces its Arizona operations, it should probably increase its simulations to train its models.</p>



<p>Real-world experiments are costly: Waymo is erecting a whole mock city for self-driving simulations. However, only a few businesses can afford such costs.</p>



<p>On the other hand, industry leaders such as Google have relied on simulations to generate millions of hours of artificial driving data for training their algorithms to reduce data generation costs.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/02/21/145289/the-ganfather-the-man-whos-given-machines-the-gift-of-imagination/"><u>Ian Goodfellow</u></a>&nbsp;et al. introduced Generative adversarial neural networks (GAN), in 2014. These networks represent a recent advancement in image recognition. They are made up of a generator network and a discriminator. While the generator network creates synthetic images that are as realistic as possible, the discriminator network attempts to distinguish between real and synthetic images.</p>



<p>Both networks create new nodes and layers to improve their performance. While this method is commonly used in neural networks for image recognition, it has applications outside of neural networks. It can also be utilized for other machine learning techniques.</p>



<h2><strong>Applications of Synthetic Data</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Synthetic data enables us to keep building new and disruptive products and solutions even when the data needed is not present or available.</p>



<p>Today, the application of synthetic data is seen in financial services, automotive and robotics, healthcare, manufacturing, and more. Additionally, there are several application areas for synthetic data including machine learning, HR, marketing, and DevOps/agile development.</p>



<p>Ford researchers explained in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/04/23/ford-ai-data/"><u>recent podcast</u></a>&nbsp;how they merge generative adversarial networks (GANs) and gaming engines to generate synthetic data for AI training.</p>



<p>Additionally, BMW developed <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/04/13/nvidia-bmw-factory-future/"><u>a virtual factory utilizing NVIDIA Omniverse</u></a>, a simulation platform that allows organizations to work collaboratively using multiple tools, to improve the process of making cars. Data generation by BMW is used to fine-tune how production workers and robots collaborate to build cars efficiently.</p>



<p>Synthetic data is used by healthcare professionals in fields such as medical imaging for training AI models while safeguarding patient privacy. Curai, for instance, trained a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/08/21/curai-ai-healthcare-app/"><u>diagnostic model on four hundred thousand simulated medical cases</u></a>.</p>



<p>GANs are also gaining traction in finance. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/12/10/american-express-deep-learning/"><u>American Express</u></a>&nbsp;investigated ways to use GANs to generate synthetic data to improve its AI models that detect fraud.</p>



<p>In retail, startups like <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/12/05/caper-smart-carts-roll-out-to-assist-shoppers-and-avoid-checkouts/"><u>Caper use 3D</u></a>&nbsp;simulations to take as little as five images of a product and generate a synthetic dataset of 1000 images. These datasets activate smart stores in which customers can grab all that they need and walk out without having to wait in a checkout line.</p>

<p>The industries are accumulating unimaginable volumes of data with each passing day. Companies are experimenting with a variety of methods for processing large amounts of data and putting it to good use. They&#8217;re looking at the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence&#8217;s predictive analytics, which allows for AI-based decision-making.</p>



<p>According to a PwC survey, <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/ai-predictions.html"><u>86 percent of respondents</u></a>&nbsp;believe AI would be the &#8220;mainstream technology&#8221; in their companies by 2021. Their companies have expanded their AI investments and intentions for AI deployment.</p>



<p>Every day, AI makes critical decisions for us. AI is having an impact on everything from smart weather prediction to YouTube and Netflix video recommendations. Hospitals are implementing AI-powered technologies to cut administrative costs and provide actionable insights to healthcare workers. The marketing sector uses automated ad campaigns to achieve high conversion rates, among other things.</p>



<h2><strong>The Three AI Levels in Decision-Making</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>For ages, human reason and intellect have guided vital decision-making. Wisdom and intellect are no longer credible in the face of petabytes of available data.</p>



<p>According to a Gartner survey, the existing decision-making process is unsustainable and must be re-engineered. According to the report, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-make-better-business-decisions"><u>65 percent of today&#8217;s decisions</u></a>&nbsp;are more complicated than they were two years ago.</p>



<p>Modern judgments necessitate a technological approach to analyzing massive amounts of data. Because of its ability to handle large amounts of data and forecast outcomes, AI has become an important aspect of strategic decision-making. There are three stages of AI-assisted decision-making, as detailed below.</p>



<h3>1.&nbsp;<strong>Decision Support</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Data is analyzed using various AI approaches to gather critical insights. A mix of data-driven insights, the human mind, emotion, and intelligence goes into making the final decision.</p>



<h3>2.&nbsp;<strong>Decision Augmentation</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>AI quickly analyzes large amounts of complex data and makes recommendations. Humans can approve or reject AI recommendations based on their knowledge and skill.</p>



<h3>3.&nbsp;<strong>Decision Automation</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>AI&#8217;s prediction powers are precise and reliable enough that it may be trusted to make judgments on its own. Without human interference, systems can make their own decisions.</p>



<h2><strong>8 Ways AI Is Transforming Business Decision Making</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Here, we will discuss 8 major ways AI is influencing decision-making. Let&#8217;s examine how artificial intelligence can assist you in making better decisions.</p>



<h3>1.&nbsp;<strong>Marketing Decision-Making</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Here are some examples of how AI can aid in business decision-making. The decision-making process has become even more difficult as disruptive market forces have taken hold.</p>



<p>Understanding client demands and matching products to meet those needs is difficult. As a result, companies are now seeking for techniques to predict client behavior, which is critical for marketing decisions.</p>



<p>To acquire useful insights, AI-enabled algorithms examine client data related to their surfing history. Businesses make efficient marketing decisions based on such information.</p>



<p>Launching marketing campaigns targeting prospects, sending product recommendations, and delivering customized mailings to provide customers with exactly what they want are just a few examples.</p>



<p>Spotify and Netflix utilize AI and ML algorithms for recommending episodes and music based on the preferences of their consumers.</p>



<p>As customers become accustomed to the number of individualized suggestions provided by services such as Netflix and Spotify, they seek for other brands to deliver the same level of service. This is how artificial intelligence (AI) makes commercial decision-making easier.</p>



<h3>2.&nbsp;<strong>Customer Relationship Management</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a system that allows businesses to manage all of their communications and relationships with current and potential customers. The true objective of maintaining a CRM is to improve company relationships.</p>



<p>Technologies keep track of multiple aspects of a user&#8217;s activity at the same time, giving them a complete picture of their shifting preferences. Marketers gain specific information that enables them to generate distinctive services and allocate budget to various marketing channels, such as television, radio, and the Internet.</p>



<p>Artificial Intelligence generates customized recommendations for salesmen based on relevant data input into the CRM system. Customized sales, messages, and emails to be delivered at specific times are examples of this.</p>



<p>Data entry takes up <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/falonfatemi/2019/08/10/5-ways-artificial-intelligence-is-transforming-crms/?sh=53f3df7c5354"><u>17% of sales professionals&#8217; time</u></a>, which equates to nearly one workday every week. The most important hurdle to CRM adoption is manual data entry.</p>



<p>AI-driven algorithms process large amounts of data in minutes, culminating in relevant business insights. While humans experience decision fatigue, AI systems do not, making the entire decision-making process more efficient. This is how AI makes it easier to decide on the business.</p>



<p>As per research by Nimdzi Insights and Pactera Technologies, <a href="https://en.pactera.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pactera-Nimdzi-Whitepaper-AI-in-Localization-1.pdf"><u>51 percent of businesses</u></a>&nbsp;used artificial intelligence in 2017.</p>



<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/connect/callminer-eureka/"><u>CallMiner Eureka</u></a>, for instance, captures and transcribes client interactions using machine language and AI. These transcriptions are categorized using a rich categorization framework and major subjects.</p>



<p>When this information is entered into a CRM, it quickly generates crucial insights and linked specific data. This is how artificial intelligence (AI) aids in commercial decision-making.</p>



<h3>3.&nbsp;<strong>Recommendation System</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s continue talking about how AI makes business decisions easier. The recommended system (engine) is a system that suggests products or other objects to consumers based on their interests and likes. Initially, these recommendation systems were mostly employed on music websites, but they are increasingly being used across a wide range of businesses.</p>



<p>Businesses utilize recommendation systems to learn about their customers&#8217; preferences and decisions. Based on &#8216;explicit&#8217; or &#8216;implicit&#8217; input, the system employs AI algorithms to deliver extensive information on the consumer&#8217;s preferences.</p>



<p>These data can help marketing teams devise the best strategy for minimizing bounce rates and delivering more customer-centric content. This is one method in which artificial intelligence can assist in commercial decision-making.</p>



<p>AI can help both the economy and humanity grow by acting as a capital hybrid. It will undoubtedly have a transformative effect on decision-making.</p>



<h3>4.&nbsp;<strong>Opinion Mining</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Opinion mining is one of the ways AI is now impacting decision-making. AI holds a lot of promise for providing reliable information to decision-makers.</p>



<p>It can take a long time to go through all of your customers&#8217; reviews and social media mentions. Because people continue to publish at all hours of the day and night, this analysis will never truly cease. The larger the company, the more difficult this problem may be. Smart algorithms can compile reviews and comments from a variety of sources and uncover trends for you.</p>



<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) supplies organizations with a wealth of information about their customers. This aids them in fully comprehending customer requirements. It also aids retailers in forecasting demand for products.</p>



<p>Opinion mining aids firms in comprehending customer input and the reasons for their preferences. To provide actionable insights, all of these perspectives are adequately acquired and processed.</p>



<p>This information will aid businesses in anticipating client difficulties and taking proper action when making critical business decisions. This is how artificial intelligence (AI) makes business decision-making easier.</p>



<h3>5.&nbsp;<strong>Augmented Analytics</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Businesses may make better judgments by evaluating data with Augmented Analytics. Careful data analysis allows businesses to obtain greater insights, which aids in the development of effective marketing plans.</p>



<p>As per a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-02-18-gartner-identifies-top-10-data-and-analytics-technolo"><u>recent Gartner news release</u></a>, Augmented Analytics will be the next big thing, transforming the way analytics content is enhanced, enlarged, and shared.</p>



<p>When corporate executives and decision-makers have access to credible data and recommendations, they make wise and precise business judgments. The application of modern AI approaches not only increases the productivity of individual team members but also helps organizations outperform their market competitors.</p>



<h3>6.&nbsp;<strong>Pricing Strategy</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Another application of AI in decision-making is to assist in the calculation of product prices. Your managers will be unable to efficiently review hundreds or thousands of product pricing daily. However, AI can assist them.</p>



<p>Smart technologies not only quickly evaluate large amounts of data, but they also catch pricing relationships that humans may miss. A price change for one item, for instance, may impact the sales of several others.</p>



<h3>7.&nbsp;<strong>Problem-Solving</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Expert systems are used by corporations from numerous fields to have technologies immediately handle difficulties. These are artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools that mimic human problem-solving abilities. These systems identify and evaluate data to make additional recommendations for resolving specific problems.</p>



<h3>8.&nbsp;<strong>Business Expansion</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>It&#8217;s great to hear that your company is expanding. However, you are unsure which direction to expand in, which poses a dilemma. For this case, using AI in decision-making is a successful application of technology.</p>



<p>For example, AI considers the company&#8217;s growth, client persona and behavior, and a list of potential sites when deciding where to open a new branch office. It then suggests location modifications that are most likely to yield the highest return on investment.</p>



<h2><strong>Final Word</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Technology is rapidly evolving and modern AI-centric methodologies are replacing traditional software development strategies. Businesses are becoming more aware of the advantages of adopting AI into their decision-making process, as it promises a higher return on investment.</p>



<p>Investors and stakeholders will have more confidence in AI as more businesses continue to invest in AI and develop solutions at scale. More importantly, they will begin to count more on AI to drive their crucial business decisions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Marketing stands to benefit greatly from artificial intelligence. Understanding consumer demands, matching them to products and services, and enticing people to buy are all key marketing operations that AI can greatly improve.</p>



<p>Today, AI is frequently utilized in marketing campaigns where speed is critical. AI systems learn how to engage with customers based on data and customer profiles effectively. They then give them personalized messages at the perfect time without the marketing team’s involvement, ensuring optimal productivity. AI is being used by many marketers today to supplement marketing teams or to execute more tactical activities that require less human finesse.</p>



<p>While AI has made advances in marketing, we expect it to play a bigger role in the coming years across the board. Given the technology&#8217;s great potential, Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) must be aware of the various marketing AI applications available currently and how they may evolve in the future.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left" id="ai-marketing-at-a-glance"><strong>AI Marketing at a Glance</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>AI marketing is a technique for enhancing the consumer experience via the use of technology. You can also use it to improve marketing campaigns&#8217; return on investment (ROI). This is performed by gaining insight into your target market through big data analytics, machine learning, and other techniques.</p>



<p>You can establish more effective client touchpoints with this knowledge. AI eliminates most of the guesswork involved in client interactions, whether you&#8217;re doing email marketing or giving customer service.</p>



<p>On a larger scale, it can be utilized to automate activities that formerly required human intervention. AI marketing can be used for content creation, PPC advertising, and even web design. Also, many ad agencies today rely on AI to aid their video marketing efforts.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left" id="why-ai-marketing-is-important"><strong>Why AI Marketing Is Important</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Artificial intelligence has a major impact on digital marketing. Customers want organizations to understand their requirements and expectations, according to <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/resources/articles/customer-expectations/?sfdc-redirect=369"><u>76% of customers</u></a>. Marketers may crunch a large number of marketing data analytics from social networking sites, emails, and the Web in a relatively small period with AI marketing. As a result, AI marketing is a must-have for any company.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the advantages of AI marketing.</p>



<h3 id="1-automation">1.&nbsp;<strong>Automation</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>AI improves the intelligence of your marketing automation. It can be used in conjunction with marketing automation to help you turn data into decisions, meaningful encounters, and great business outcomes.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all about data, but it&#8217;s even more important to turn data into meaningful insights rapidly and accurately. In other words, one of the most important benefits of AI marketing is the efficiency with which marketing tasks are completed and performed.</p>



<p>AI can assist marketers in increasing the number of campaigns they develop, determining the next best steps for customers, and then accurately defining which campaign to send them.</p>



<p>AI in email marketing automation is a tool that companies can utilize to boost client engagement and open rates while saving money. By improving subject lines for clicks and tracking their success, AI moves one step ahead of a copywriter.</p>



<p>Persado, a New York-based business that applies <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-chase-taps-ai-to-make-marketing-messages-more-powerful-11564482606"><u>AI technology to marketing creativity</u></a>, has secured a five-year partnership with Chase Bank. Chase discovered that integrating ML algorithms in their copywriting helped them attain more humanity in their marketing after trying Persado&#8217;s solutions.</p>



<p>AI can also create and optimize content in a variety of email formats that is user-friendly and relevant. Additionally, AI is employed in social media automation and businesses use it to boost customer interaction and optimize content, just as they do with email marketing.</p>



<h3 id="2-cost-savings">2.&nbsp;<strong>Cost Savings</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Many of the slash-and-burn resources often used to establish and implement a marketing strategy can be eliminated with AI. By working more swiftly and efficiently with AI, you can save a lot of money while also increasing your revenue.</p>



<p>When your company is wasting too much money and time trying to get things done, artificial intelligence (AI) can assist you in completing repetitive and tedious activities. It reduces the amount of time that your employees spend on certain jobs while also eliminating errors. Firms can greatly reduce hiring expenditures while taking advantage of the available talent to perform more vital tasks.</p>



<p>In short, you can function better with AI. A content manager, for instance, can utilize AI to execute thousands of copy and creative versions of A/B tests and automatically build email subject lines, accelerating the process and outperforming humans.</p>



<h3 id="3-increased-roi">3.&nbsp;<strong>Increased ROI</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Marketers may use AI to understand their customers better and improve their experiences. Marketers may use AI-powered marketing to generate a predictive customer analysis and plan a more focused and individually designed customer experience, effectively increasing ROI on each customer encounter.</p>



<p>Marketers can use AI to get deeper customer insights, better group them, and guide them to the next stage in their journey to provide the best experience possible.</p>



<p>Marketers can maximize ROI by studying customer insights and knowing what customers want rather than wasting money on ineffective initiatives. They can also stay away from mindless advertisements that irritate clients.</p>



<h3 id="4-increased-personalization">4.&nbsp;<strong>Increased Personalization</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>We&#8217;ve heard a lot about personalization in the digital realm of purchasing. When it comes to internet buying, buyers are increasingly looking for this.</p>



<p>So, what is the secret to improved personalization that eCommerce businesses may employ to capture the hearts of their customers?</p>



<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the answer.</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence will tailor your marketing in a variety of ways. Many businesses are already using AI in their web pages, emails, social media postings, video, and other content to better cater to their customers&#8217; needs.</p>



<p>Making push notifications mobile-friendly, for example, is helping eCommerce businesses achieve better outcomes. Customers pay more attention to push notifications given via mobile when they are done well because they generate a sense of personalization.</p>



<p>Each customer will get their individualized push alerts with custom-tailored messaging based on what they&#8217;ve seen or exactly what they want to hear from a brand.</p>



<p>Product suggestions are another fantastic AI marketing tactic that personalizes the consumer experience beyond what many marketers imagined was possible.</p>



<p>According to Aberdeen Research, organizations that use predictive analytics to detect customer needs can boost organic revenue by <a href="https://www.aberdeen.com/"><u>21 percent year over year</u></a>, compared to an average of 12 percent without predictive analytics.</p>



<p><a href="https://demand-planning.com/2018/05/29/how-starbucks-uses-predictive-analytics-and-your-loyalty-card-data/"><u>Starbucks</u></a>&nbsp;is an example of a company that collects and analyzes client data through its loyalty card and mobile app. In 2016, they announced intentions for personalization.</p>



<p>Since then, they&#8217;ve created a fantastic app. It keeps track of purchases, including where they were made and when they were made.</p>



<p>Starbucks employs predictive analytics to process this information and send targeted marketing messages to customers. When a user visits a nearby retailer, these communications include suggestions and special offers aimed at increasing the customer&#8217;s average order value.</p>



<h3 id="5-smarter-and-faster-decision-making">5.&nbsp;<strong>Smarter and Faster Decision Making</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>AI speeds up data processing compared to human intervention, ensures accuracy and security, and allows your team to focus on strategic efforts to create effective AI-powered campaigns.</p>



<p>AI can gather and monitor real-time tactical data, allowing marketers to make decisions right now rather than waiting until the campaign is over. They may decide what to do next by relying on data-driven reports, resulting in better and more objective decisions.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left" id="how-ai-is-helping-companies-to-improve-marketing-roi"><strong>How AI Is Helping Companies to Improve Marketing ROI</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Companies are gradually increasing the importance of artificial intelligence in their marketing campaigns as AI algorithms evolve and superior processing power becomes more readily available.</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence is frequently used to decipher the signals hidden beneath oceans of data. It gives businesses a competitive advantage by delivering strong predictive insights into customer behavior. The following are some of the key ways AI is helping companies to improve marketing ROI.</p>



<h3 id="1-predicting-purchasing-patterns-using-predictive-analytics">1.&nbsp;<strong>Predicting Purchasing Patterns Using Predictive Analytics</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Predictive analytics makes use of large amounts of data to predict future outcomes. Target, for example, has put a premium on predictive analytics to predict buyer purchasing habits accurately.</p>



<p>In 2012, the company made news when they correctly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/?sh=6614608d6668"><u>predicted a teenager&#8217;s pregnancy</u></a>&nbsp;based on her shopping habits, before she even realized she was pregnant herself.</p>



<p>This incident demonstrates both the precision of marketing businesses&#8217; algorithms and the ongoing need for human control when using these emerging technologies.</p>



<h3 id="2-achieving-sophisticated-object-recognition-with-deep-learning">2.&nbsp;<strong>Achieving Sophisticated Object Recognition with Deep Learning</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Deep learning allows a computer to &#8220;learn&#8221; how to recognize patterns in photos, text, voice, and other data to extract useful data. No discussion on deep learning would be complete without noting Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-02-facebook-trained-image-recognition-ai-instagram-pics.html"><u>usage of a powerful object-recognition engine</u></a>&nbsp;based on user-submitted photographs from Instagram.</p>



<p>While the company claims that the information gathered isn&#8217;t being used to analyze user behavior better, the site&#8217;s recent open-sourcing opens the door for other businesses to employ this predictive technology as well.</p>



<h3 id="3-enhancing-customer-experience-through-the-use-of-chatbots">3.&nbsp;<strong>Enhancing Customer Experience Through the Use of Chatbots</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Companies are using artificial intelligence outside of the IT industry to improve the consumer experience. Companies are giving customers smart, reactive, and dynamic 1:1 communication that answers their needs and assists them in identifying useful services with the assistance of intelligent chatbots.</p>



<p>Shell, a major oil and gas corporation, launched a new chatbot named &#8220;<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/meet-shelly-shell-s-siri-like-bot-that-answers-all-your-lubricant-doubts-117111600478_1.html"><u>Shelly</u></a>&#8221; in 2018 to assist consumers in determining which upgrades are most beneficial for their vehicles.</p>



<p>Shelly not only helps the brand promote a 1:1 customer experience but as per Shell India’s MD Mansi Madan Tripathy, Shelly&#8217;s intelligent product assignment also decreases downtime and lowers customer operational expenses by 25-30%.</p>



<p>Shelly&#8217;s use of sensor-driven data integration, according to Tripathy, will improve the safety and operating excellence of fleets that incorporate the new technology into their systems.</p>



<h3 id="4-more-synched-online-content-and-store-visits-with-automated-image-recognition">4.&nbsp;<strong>More Synched Online Content and Store Visits With Automated Image Recognition</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>AI is used by big firms like Amazon, Facebook, and Google to recognize people and objects in photos and videos with a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235783#:~:text=At%20present%2C%20deep%20learning%20algorithms,to%2099.75%25%20%5B5%5D."><u>99.75 percent accuracy rate</u></a>.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a Facebook user, you&#8217;ve probably noticed how good the system has gotten at detecting and automatically tagging your friends&#8217; faces in your images.</p>



<p>Image recognition can help marketers better align online content with in-store visits. Many stores use face recognition software to track customers&#8217; in-store visits and link them to their profiles so they may have a better online buying experience.</p>



<p>Others integrate this technology with AI-driven push alerts to provide customers targeted offers, discounts, and messaging in real-time. This improves interactions between stores and customers while also prolonging their excitement while in the store.</p>



<h3 id="5-improving-marketing-campaigns-with-speech-recognition-technology">5.&nbsp;<strong>Improving Marketing Campaigns with Speech Recognition Technology</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Want to experience what it&#8217;s like to be Jarvis from the Marvel film &#8220;Iron Man&#8221;? Jarvis may be years ahead of his time in terms of technology, but it doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t happen.</p>



<p>Similar AIs with speech recognition skills are currently available. Are you familiar with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri? These are just a few of the most popular voice recognition chatbots.</p>



<p>To carry out the command, these AIs can identify spoken words and/or convert them to text. Even programs like Shazam, Google Maps, and other hands-free systems require speech recognition.</p>



<p>So, how can marketers use voice recognition in their marketing campaigns? By 2022, more than 55% of homes will have a smart speaker, up from 13% in 2018.</p>



<p>Furthermore, voice shopping revenues are predicted to increase to USD 40 billion by 2022, up from USD 2-billion in 2018. If the research is to be accepted, this speaks (pun intended) volumes about the importance of using speech recognition in your marketing strategy.</p>



<h2 id="final-word"><strong>Final Word</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Humans just cannot match the efficiency that AI provides. Even if humans could equal their robot counterparts, the resource-intensive aspect of such work benefits organizations that use non-programmable activities to utilize the abilities of their employees.</p>



<p>Modern marketers must begin investigating and implementing the different ways in which AI might help them achieve their company goals. Companies that wait too long to adjust following an industry-wide paradigm shift may find themselves hurrying to catch up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Artificial Intelligence is reshaping the IT industry by supporting businesses in reaching their goals, making critical decisions, and inventing new products and services.</p>



<p>By 2022, many AI companies are anticipated to have several artificial intelligence initiatives in place. By 2022, the AI and machine learning market are predicted to grow at a 44 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artificial-intelligence-platform-market-worth-988-billion-usd-by-2022-658814893.html"><u>US$9 billion</u></a>. In recent years, there have been several developments in AI and machine learning technologies, and the same is expected during the coming year. We will go through some of the most important AI predictions for 2022 in this article.</p>



<h2>1.&nbsp;<strong>There Will Be Mass Adoption of AI by Businesses</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Employees are more expensive than software. It does not require health insurance or FICA contributions. Even if you employ subscription-based software-as-a-service, you&#8217;re probably saving money compared to hiring someone.</p>



<p>AI differs from other software in that it does real work rather than supporting employees with their tasks. As a result, AI is a natural choice for cost-cutting strategies. At the very least, when it performs as well as a person.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that this happens more frequently than you believe. Nina, a bot created by Swedbank, takes customer calls and answers inquiries, and she succeeds <a href="https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2017/03/getting-smart-artificial-intelligence/"><u>80 percent of the time</u></a>.</p>



<p>That success rate could explain why, by 2022, an estimated <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/abi-research-forecasts-almost-one-million-businesses-worldwide-will-adopt-ai-technologies-by-2022-300475890.html"><u>900,000 businesses</u></a>&nbsp;will have adopted AI technology.</p>



<h2>2.&nbsp;<strong>AI will have a Greater Role in Hyper-Automation</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Hyper automation is the process of using advanced technologies to automate tasks. Other words for the same thing include intelligent process automation and digital process automation.</p>



<p>Companies can utilize conversational AI and RPA to automatically respond to client inquiries and improve their CSAT score. By automating time-consuming activities, businesses may reduce employee manual work and increase production. Companies can use hyper-automation to infuse digital technologies into their processes. One of the best AI trends is hyper-automation.</p>



<h2>3.&nbsp;<strong>Many Skilled Workers Will Be Replaced by AI Technology</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Consider a future in which humans are supplanted by relentless, productive robots. It&#8217;s a prevalent theme in science fiction, but it usually involves low-skill or manual laborers.</p>



<p>Ironically, the pay of menial and physical laborers are so low that large company has no financial incentive to replace them. However, the job security of some expensive and highly qualified professionals may be jeopardized.</p>



<p>Many jobs in law, finance, IT, and medicine are routine and follow well-defined procedures. Work that is routine, defined, and has a small number of foreseeable outcomes is good for AI. We only pay high prices for these services now because they are performed by professionals.</p>



<h2>4.&nbsp;<strong>We Will Witness the Evolution of Augmented Intelligence</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Augmented Intelligence is one of the most popular AI trends. Augmented Intelligence refers to the use of robots and humans to increase cognitive performance.</p>



<p>By 2023, Gartner predicts that <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-the-future-of-ai-technologies"><u>40% of operations and infrastructure teams</u></a>&nbsp;will use AI-augmented automation to improve IT productivity. In fact, by 2022, digital employees&#8217; contributions will have climbed by 50%.</p>



<p>Systems with Augmented Intelligence may gather all types of data from different sources, both structured and unstructured, and display it in a 360-degree view of customers. Travel, retail, healthcare, and financial services are just a few of the areas that are embracing Augmented Intelligence.</p>



<h2>5.&nbsp;<strong>Enterprise Metaverse Will Become a Reality in Over Five Deployments Due to 3D Computer Vision</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/predictions-2022-artificial-intelligence/RES176461?objectid=RES176461"><u>Forrester</u></a>, the metaverse — the merging of real and digital worlds — is quickly becoming the next big thing in technology. According to the firm, Tencent, Roblox, and Facebook have already made significant investments in space. At the <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/key-announcements-made-at-microsoft-ignite-2021/"><u>recent Ignite conference</u></a>, Microsoft also introduced a metaverse component for its Teams collaboration program.</p>



<p>According to Forrester, the retail metaverse bubble will burst in 2022 due to cryptocurrency and gambling rules, inadequate connectivity for real-time experiences, and other constraints. Meanwhile, as per Forrester, enterprise metaverse solutions will advance toward successful early deployments, allowing hybrid and remote workforces to join.</p>



<h2>6.&nbsp;<strong>Most Deliveries Will Still Be Made By Humans, Not Drones</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>You order pizza, and half an hour later, a drone powered by Artificial Intelligence delivers it to your door. The transaction is completed when you wave your smartphone at the drone to pay. It&#8217;s a good concept, but it&#8217;s impractical in the short run.</p>



<p>While drone technology is undeniably amazing and rapidly evolving, it is quick enough for this case.</p>



<p>Recent incidents involving self-driving cars show that AI navigation still has a long way to go. Furthermore, the flight component adds to the complexity of drone navigation. The drone will have to deal with anything from electricity cables to tree branches to birds in real-time.</p>



<p>Drone delivery also has to account for package weight and size, energy consumption, and the usual legal stumbling blocks.</p>



<h2>7.&nbsp;<strong>There Will Be More Business Analysis and Forecasting Using AI and ML</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Business forecasting and analysis utilizing AI and ML have proven to be significantly easier than any previous method or technology. You may use AI and machine learning to consider thousands of matrices to make more accurate predictions and projections.</p>



<p>Fintech firms, for instance, are employing Artificial Intelligence to forecast demand for different currencies in real-time based on market conditions and client behavior. It enables Fintech companies to have the right amount of supply to meet demand.</p>



<h2>8.&nbsp;<strong>Language Modeling Will Improve</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Language modeling makes it possible for machines to interact with humans in a language that both humans and machines understand. It may also convert human languages into computer code that can be used to operate applications and programs.</p>



<p>After OpenAI&#8217;s recent release of <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/explainers/explained-can-a-computer-win-a-literature-nobel-gpt-4-could-take-us-closer-to-epic-potential-of-ai-4220339.html"><u>GPT-4</u></a>, the heir to the most powerful language model ever constructed, the language modeling process is expected to improve even more next year. GTP-4 will be more potent and larger than GTP-3, with the ability to construct language and carry on conversations that are indistinguishable from those uttered by humans. According to OpenAI, computer code generation will also be improved.</p>



<h2>9.&nbsp;<strong>Responsible AI Will Take Center Stage</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Responsible AI aids in achieving fairness, even though biases are baked into the data. It helps gain trust, even though openness and explainability procedures are evolving. Finally, AI also helps achieve compliance with regulations while contending with its probabilistic nature.</p>



<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2021/03/ai-should-augment-human-intelligence-not-replace-it"><u>David De Cremer and Garry Kasparov</u></a>&nbsp;wrote in Harvard Business Review that AI-based devices are &#8220;faster, more accurate, more consistently rational,&#8221; but that current AI advances typically lack understanding, emotional maturity, and cultural sensitivity.</p>



<p>While end-to-end automation and accompanying employment cutbacks are not among the AI trends for 2022, administrations will need to tackle the moral consequences of AI adoption in their national AI initiatives to ensure favorable automation outcomes for all stakeholders.</p>



<p>When it comes to business AI, organizations should concentrate on developing intelligent algorithms that explain their conclusions and are not biased against people based on their race, age, gender, religion, or location.</p>



<p>To get employees on board and motivate them to participate in AI deployment and training, stakeholders must clearly articulate the benefits of automation.</p>



<h2>10.&nbsp;<strong>AI’s Role in Cybersecurity Will Increase</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>In the field of cybersecurity, AI has already made significant progress. Because cybercrime is such a serious threat to civilization, the world is always working to prevent it. To keep your data protected from hackers and cyber attackers, AI analyses the traffic on your network and detects intrusions.</p>



<p>Technology and the internet are pervasive in our daily lives. Because we rely so largely on technology, cybersecurity has become a need. For example, banking and finance companies are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to detect fraudulent actions.</p>



<p>With the use of AI, companies are developing new approaches to make cybersecurity more streamlined and risk-free. Businesses are using AI to improve their cloud migration plans and the efficiency of big data technology.</p>



<p>The cybersecurity industry for AI and machine learning is anticipated to reach <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-internet-of-things-iot-security-market-to-reach-38-2-billion-by-2026--301365001.html"><u>US$38.2 billion by 2026</u></a>. A significant number of data points are involved in cybersecurity.</p>



<p>As a result, AI could be used to cluster, classify, analyze, and filter data in cybersecurity. By arranging data in a specific way, AI can help you correlate numerous data sets and look for dangers. You can use AL and ML to identify malware and risks by developing a security platform that scans large amounts of data.</p>



<h2>11.&nbsp;<strong>Explainable AI Will Gain Traction</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Explainable AI is a forerunner to the responsible AI tenet, which alleviates a slew of regulatory and compliance difficulties. The combination of AI&#8217;s knowledge foundation and its statistical foundation provides unparalleled explainability.</p>



<p>Words are used in reasoning systems because they are more understandable to most people than figures. There are explicit links between outputs and inputs with guidelines. The end-user and the developer both benefit from such explainability.</p>



<p>You can link back to the fundamental data sources where you acquired the responses when you return search results so that consumers can see the data in context. Developers can observe which cognitive processes are engaged to answer questions, allowing them to simply alter those that are giving incorrect responses to improve them.</p>



<p>There are several model management tools available to make explainable AI for learning systems easier. Top ones provide users with a comprehensive collection of measures for a model&#8217;s performance as well as reveal what was employed when the model was created.</p>



<p>There are also measurements for defining the evolution of models over time for insight into the underlying infrastructure, environment, and model life so that it keeps track of it when you produce new versions of that model.</p>



<h2>12.&nbsp;<strong>Creative AI Systems Will Become Prominent</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Creative AI is a new field of Artificial Intelligence that may be used to paint, write captivating stories, make music, and much more. Marketing professionals, for example, will soon be employing AI to compose newsletters and articles, as well as generate designs, thanks to evolving technologies. The effectiveness of AI is far more than we can conceive.</p>



<p>Although creativity is regarded to be a natural human quality, <a href="https://qz.com/africa/2044477/south-africa-grants-patent-to-an-ai-system-known-as-dabus/"><u>South Africa</u></a>&nbsp;granted the first patent to a creative AI system in 2021. While the EU and US both dismissed the same patent application on the basis that only humans are eligible for patents, this landmark step toward legal protection and recognition of AI-created goods will spur more innovative AI innovation.</p>



<h2>13.&nbsp;<strong>The Healthcare Industry Will Increase Its Use of AI Technologies</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Big data has been used extensively to identify COVID patients. AI is already making a big and accurate contribution to the healthcare industry. Researchers have also developed thermal cameras and smartphone apps to monitor individual temperatures and gather data for healthcare organizations.</p>



<p>By evaluating data and anticipating potential outcomes, Artificial Intelligence may assist healthcare facilities in a variety of ways. AI and machine learning systems offer insights into human health and suggest ways to avoid sickness. AI also enables doctors to keep track of their patient&#8217;s health from a distance, allowing for more teleconsultation and virtual treatment.</p>



<h2>14.&nbsp;<strong>Sustainability in Big Organizations Will Be Driven by AI</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Governments and corporations alike may use AI to minimize dependency on fossil fuels, counteract deforestation, and lower CO2 emissions through 2022 and beyond. While national-level green AI solutions are still rare, we&#8217;ve seen several commercial AI implementations that help organizations achieve their sustainability goals.</p>



<p>For example, Google&#8217;s data center cooling technology was combined with deep learning, resulting in a <a href="https://medium.com/the-fourth-wave/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-by-40-bd3ef8cfe36e"><u>40% reduction</u></a>&nbsp;in energy use. Furthermore, Boston Consulting Group&#8217;s CO2 AI, a unique, sustainable AI technology, assists businesses in reducing CO2 emissions by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markminevich/2021/10/08/11-examples-of-ai-climate-change-solutions-for-zero-carbon/?sh=7a3b785b2251"><u>30–40%</u></a>&nbsp;by precisely evaluating their carbon footprint and generating intelligent recommendations.</p>



<h2><strong>Final Word</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>AI is here to stay unless a catastrophic event makes it impossible to use computer technology on the planet. By 2022, it will be in control of a slew of business procedures as well as a substantial chunk of our routines. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will also take over a multitude of time-consuming professional responsibilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The potential for quantum computing to disrupt the entire planet, economies, and industries is enormous. Artificial Intelligence is having an ever-increasing impact all over the world already. With the integration of quantum computing into AI, this influence will be multiplied.</p>



<p>In other words, quantum computing can play an important role in the artificial intelligence revolution. In this article, we will look at how quantum computing can enable and speed up the AI revolution happening globally.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Quantum Computing?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Quantum computing is a field of study that focuses on the creation of computer-based systems based on quantum theoretical principles. Quantum theory focuses on the nature and behavior of energy and matter on the quantum—atomic and subatomic levels.</p>



<p>To perform certain computing tasks, quantum computing utilizes a combination of bits. All of this is accomplished at a far higher efficiency than their traditional counterparts. Quantum computers represent a significant advancement in computing capability, with enormous performance benefits for specific use cases.</p>



<p>The <em>qubit</em>, rather than the traditional bit, is the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing. The essential feature of this alternative system is that it allows for the coordinated juxtaposition of ones and zeros, the binary digits that all computing is based on.</p>



<p>Researchers have studied the quantum computer versus classical computer comparison extensively and have long expected that quantum computers would be able to solve specific kinds of problems much faster than any traditional computer, particularly those involving a large number of variables and possible outcomes, such as simulations or optimization questions.</p>



<p>Quantum computing will see a rapid spike in companies using it to their respective industries as technology evolves and becomes more accessible.</p>



<p>For example, computational models that incorporate probability and assumptions about how markets and holdings will perform are frequently used by financial analysts. Quantum computers could help by processing through data faster, running better prediction models, and balancing conflicting alternatives more accurately.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Quantum AI?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The usage of quantum computing for the processing of machine learning algorithms is known as quantum AI. Quantum AI can help reach results that are impossible to obtain with traditional computers due to quantum computing&#8217;s computational abilities.</p>



<p>Although artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly during the last decade, it has yet to overcome technical limits. Obstacles to achieving AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) can be overcome thanks to the unique capabilities of quantum computing.</p>



<p>Quantum computing can be utilized to train machine learning models quickly and generate more efficient algorithms.</p>



<p>Quantum computing can deliver an optimized and robust AI that can perform years of analysis in a small amount of time, resulting in technological advancements. Some of today&#8217;s AI&#8217;s fundamental issues include reasoning under ambiguity, adaptable machine learning, and neuromorphic cognitive models. Quantum AI is the best bet to overcome them.</p>



<h2><strong>How Does Quantum AI Work?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The processing power necessary to extract value from the presently unmanageable amounts of data being gathered and specifically apply artificial intelligence techniques like machine learning continues to rise.</p>



<p>Researchers have been attempting to speed up these processes by combining quantum computing methods with artificial intelligence techniques, resulting in the birth of a new discipline known as Quantum Machine Learning (QML).</p>



<p>At least for some specific models that are fundamentally difficult to learn with classical computers, quantum machine learning may be more efficient than traditional machine learning.</p>



<p>In the use of quantum computing techniques, machine learning and artificial intelligence systems are two significant areas of research. One of the unique features of this computation method is that it allows several states to be represented at the same time, which is especially useful when utilizing AI approaches.</p>



<p>Voice-assistants, for instance, might benefit immensely from this implementation since quantum could vastly improve their accuracy, enhancing both their computing power and the quantity of data they can handle, according to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-offers-ai-breakthrough-in-quantum-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Intel</u></a>.</p>



<p>Quantum computing boosts the number of computing variables that machines can handle, allowing them to respond more quickly, much like a human.</p>



<h3><strong>Google’s Quantum AI</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Google is one of the first quantum computer manufacturers to enter the market. Google announced <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/announcing-tensorflow-quantum-open.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>TensorFlow Quantum</u></a> in March 2020, which extends the TensorFlow ML development library to quantum computers.</p>



<p>TFQ&#8217;s goal is to give people the tools they need to govern and model natural and artificial quantum networks. TFQ is an example of a toolkit that integrates quantum modeling and machine learning. Quantum tensors are a multi-dimensional array of integers that can be used to depict quantum data. TensorFlow processes these tensors to build a dataset that can be used later.</p>



<p>Quantum neural network models are chosen based on the understanding of the quantum data framework. The goal is to use quantum processing to obtain information that is trapped in an entangled state.</p>



<p>Quantum state measurements retrieve conventional data from the classical distribution in the shape of samples. The values are derived directly from the quantum state. Deep learning algorithms are utilized to learn the relationship between data now that quantum data has been transformed into classical data.</p>



<h2><strong>The Use Cases of Quantum AI</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The usage of quantum computing for computing machine learning algorithms is referred to as &#8220;quantum AI.&#8221; It makes use of quantum computing&#8217;s computational prowess to achieve results that are impossible to attain with traditional computers. With that in mind, the following are some of the most important applications of this super-combination of quantum computing and artificial intelligence.</p>



<h3>1.&nbsp;<strong>Solving Complex Problems Quickly</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Our data sets are becoming more complicated and larger than our processing resources, putting a strain on our computing infrastructure.</p>



<p>While most modern computers struggle or are unable to tackle some issues, quantum computing can solve these same difficulties in seconds.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s expected that developments in quantum computing technology will improve artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, and that this will persist, even before a comprehensive quantum computing solution is available.</p>



<h3>2.&nbsp;<strong>Processing Large Datasets</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Quantum computers are meant to handle massive amounts of data while also swiftly revealing patterns and recognizing anomalies. Developers can now better manage the capacity of quantum bits with every new iteration of quantum computer design and the new enhancements made to the quantum error-correction code.</p>



<p>Quantum Computing also optimizes the same for solving various business challenges so that better decisions may be made.</p>



<h3>3.&nbsp;<strong>Detecting Patterns in Large Data Sets</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Quantum computing is projected to be capable of quickly searching huge, unsorted data sets for patterns or abnormalities. Quantum computers may be able to simultaneously access all things in your database, allowing them to identify these commonalities in seconds.</p>



<p>While this is conceptually conceivable today, it requires a parallel computer to look at each record one by one, which takes an awful lot of time and may never materialize depending on the size of the data set.</p>



<h3>4.&nbsp;<strong>Assisting IT Operations</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Where are our computer systems at risk? When should our hardware or software be upgraded? How can we address incidents more quickly? What percentage of our time is spent on things that could be automated? Big data analysis is the greatest way to address these types of ITOps queries.</p>



<p>These AI queries can provide full visibility into operational data, offering insight in real-time, thanks to the speed provided by quantum computing.</p>



<h3>5.&nbsp;<strong>Improving Business Insights and Models</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Companies are losing their ties with traditional computer rope as the volume of data produced in fields such as life science, finance, and pharmaceuticals increases. Companies today require complicated models with the computing power to model the most complex scenarios to have a better data framework. Quantum computers play a significant role in this.</p>



<p>Using quantum technology to create better models will lead to improved treatments for illnesses in the healthcare sector, such as the COVID-19 research cycle, which includes testing, tracing, and treating the infection. It will also help reduce financial meltdown in the banking sector and strengthen the logistics chain in the manufacturing sector.</p>



<h3>6.&nbsp;<strong>Integrating Data from Different Datasets</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Due to the integration of highly disparate data sets, substantial breakthroughs are envisaged when quantum computers become available. While this may be challenging at first without human participation, human input will aid the computers in learning how to integrate data in the future.</p>



<p>So, if a research team wanted to compare data from separate raw data sources, each with its schema (verbiage and column headers), a computer would need to understand the link between the schemas before the information could be compared.</p>



<p>Breakthroughs in understanding the semantics of the natural language, one of the most difficult tasks in artificial intelligence, are required to achieve this. Humans, on the other hand, can provide input that trains the system for the future.</p>



<p>Quantum computers promise to speed up the processing and integration of our massive data sets, enhancing and transforming our machine learning and artificial intelligence potential.</p>



<h3>7.&nbsp;<strong>Improving Prediction of Potential Security Risks</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>It has never been easy to keep pace with the growth of security risks and cyberattacks. However, enterprises can better detect potential security issues and thwart attacks by integrating AI&#8217;s data analytics power with the quickness of quantum computing.</p>



<p>As quantum computing and artificial intelligence advance, it&#8217;s critical to remember that validating data is just as vital as analyzing it. Data weaponization, tampering with analytics, and derailment of AI systems&#8217; experiential learning is a new form of cyberattacks that should not be overlooked.</p>



<h3>8.&nbsp;<strong>Detecting Fraud</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>The integration of AI and quantum computing in the finance industry can help improve the detection of fraud and prevent it. On the one hand, quantum computer-trained models can recognize patterns that are difficult to detect with conventional equipment. Simultaneously, the speeding of algorithms would provide significant benefits in terms of the volume of data that the machines could process for this purpose.</p>



<h3>9.&nbsp;<strong>Complimenting DevOps</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>DevOps teams can use quantum computing and artificial intelligence to help them define business goals and priorities, develop new and innovative software solutions, and manage the continuing upkeep and testing of existing applications.</p>



<p>AI data can be used by DevOps teams to help with regression testing, functionality testing, and user acceptability testing. Since quantum computing enables AI to process data from various sources (such as separate, siloed units inside a large corporation), testing can be more consistent and comprehensive.</p>



<h2><strong>Final Word</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-kernels"><u>IBM Research</u></a>&nbsp;reported earlier this year that it had discovered &#8220;mathematical proof&#8221; of a quantum edge for quantum machine learning. The evidence came in the shape of a classification algorithm that gave a &#8220;provable exponential speedup&#8221; over traditional machine learning approaches when given access to &#8220;classical data.&#8221; While there are numerous caveats to that claim, it does provide a glimpse into one future scenario in which quantum AI is viable.</p>



<p>Quantum machine learning is one of the most exciting concepts in computer science, with the potential for a lot of hype and disinformation.</p>



<p>While quantum AI appears to have promise, it is yet to be realized. On the plus side, there seems to be some reason to be hopeful that a genuine breakthrough is on the way.</p>



<p>However, due to a lack of computing power, AI may reach a new plateau in a decade, and quantum computing may emerge as the best bet to aid AI advancement.</p>



<p>It is still too early to know if quantum computing will have a significant impact on AI development. We&#8217;re still in the thick of &#8220;Noisy Intermediate-Stage Quantum,&#8221; or NISQ, as it&#8217;s known in the quantum computing community. There are a lot of exciting breakthroughs, but there are still a lot of unsolved questions. We will just wait and see how things unfold in the future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that looks to instill human intelligence in robots. A sub-branch of AI is Machine Learning (ML) that teaches machines to learn, adapt, and infer based on their own experiences rather than a series of pre-defined rules.</p>



<p>During the last few decades, the AI and ML fields have seen tremendous breakthroughs. This has given AI machine learning algorithms the ability to produce promising results in various areas, including business.</p>



<p>Today, organizations are increasingly relying on AI to help them make key business decisions, such as prioritizing healthcare in an emergency, improving recruitment practices, and determining a person&#8217;s loan, housing, and other vital services eligibility. As such, investments in artificial intelligence technologies have become critical for the survival and growth of most organizations today.</p>



<h2><strong>Benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Investments for Businesses</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on thousands of businesses throughout the world and showcased AI as a key differentiator between those who survived and those who perished. The benefits of this technology become increasingly evident as it is applied to various business operations.</p>



<p>According to the consultancy firm Capgemini&#8217;s study &#8220;<a href="https://www.capgemini.com/research/the-ai-powered-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>The Enterprise Powered by AI</u></a>,&#8221; 97 percent of the organizations surveyed indicated they had seen real benefits from AI implementation. As a result of the pandemic, 78 percent of corporate leaders stated they would continue to invest in AI in the same way they did before COVID-19, with one in five saying they intend to increase their spending.</p>



<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides businesses with a broad competitive and long-term advantage in any of the sectors where it is used, causing many CEOs worldwide to be convinced of the need to invest in AI to help their businesses grow. The following are some ways investments in AI technology can aid the survival and growth of businesses today.</p>



<h3>1.&nbsp;<strong>Efficiency and Productivity Gains</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Two of the most frequently mentioned advantages of using AI in the workplace are increased efficiency and productivity. Tasks are completed at a rate and scale that humans cannot match. Simultaneously, by removing such activities from human workers&#8217; responsibilities, AI enables them to focus on higher-value tasks that technology cannot manage.</p>



<p>This enables businesses to reduce the costs of completing monotonous, repeated tasks that can be automated while still utilizing the talent of their human resources.</p>



<h3>2.&nbsp;<strong>Better Decision-Making</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>The modern world thrives on a massive amount of data. This is true even in the case of businesses that conduct thousands and thousands of transactions in a single day. <a href="https://achievion.com/blog/5-ways-ai-improves-small-business-productivity.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>AI-assisted machines</u></a> can analyze this massive amount of data and be taught to uncover implicit patterns within it. This ability of robots is deemed to be unquestionably superior to that of humans in terms of both time and efficiency.</p>



<p>The outputs of the AI-assisted system can even be used to make inferences. AI findings are often novel, resulting in a visible difference in the decision-making process. For instance, AI may be used to anticipate which products are most likely to be purchased by a specific buyer from a specific business. This can help them make better decisions regarding marketing and product placement.</p>



<h3>3.&nbsp;<strong>Improved Monitoring</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Due to AI&#8217;s ability to handle large amounts of data in <a href="https://achievion.com/blog/how-ai-recognition-technology-is-helping-turn-images-objects-and-people-into-business-intelligence.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>real-time</u></a>, organizations can build fast monitoring capabilities that can notify them of issues, suggest action, and, in some situations, even initiate a response.</p>



<p>For instance, AI can use data collected by industrial equipment to identify issues in those pieces of machinery and forecast maintenance, preventing expensive and troublesome breakdowns as well as maintenance costs. The cost of maintenance will be kept down because maintenance work will be planned rather than being required.</p>



<p>The monitoring capabilities of AI can be used in other areas as well, such as an organization’s cybersecurity operations, where massive amounts of data must be processed and interpreted.</p>



<h3>4.&nbsp;<strong>Reduced Human Error Impacting Business</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>When AI technologies are used in processes, organizations can expect a reduction in errors as well as a tighter adherence to defined standards.</p>



<p>When AI and machine learning are combined with Robotic process automation (RPA), a system that automates monotonous, rules-based operations, the result not only speeds up processes and minimizes errors, but it can also be instructed to develop and take on a broader range of activities.</p>



<p>For instance, using AI in financial reconciliation would produce error-free findings, whereas performing the same reconciliation through human workers, even in part, is prone to errors.</p>



<h3>5.&nbsp;<strong>Better Management of Talent</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Many elements of <a href="https://achievion.com/blog/impact-ai-workforce.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>talent management</u></a> are being improved by AI, from expediting the hiring process to eliminating bias in organizational communication. By successfully finding, screening, and selecting top-tier applicants, AI-enabled procedures can save companies money on hiring expenditures while simultaneously improving workforce productivity.</p>



<p>Companies are employing chatbots to deliver tailored experiences for job hopefuls and mentor staff as natural language processing capabilities improve. AI algorithms are also being used today to assess employee sentiment, find and retain high-performers, and establish fair pay.</p>



<h3>6.&nbsp;<strong>Security Maintenance</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Malpractices and financial fraud can be detected using AI systems that have been properly trained. This ensures a secure and hassle-free transaction, increasing client trust. This feature may be particularly appealing to companies that require fully automated systems or work with high-security data.</p>



<h3>7.&nbsp;<strong>Improved Market Analysis</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>AI can be used to present information or advertisements that are only relevant to a limited number of products. <a href="https://achievion.com/blog/how-ai-can-help-transform-data-about-individuals-into-personalized-intelligence.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Trained AI systems</u></a> can successfully monitor price variations in real-time, allowing for commodity pricing revisions in response to demand.</p>



<p>This allows for the automation of existing product sales while also expanding the corporate market by exploring new, more appealing products.</p>



<p>Furthermore, they can reduce the likelihood of false positives (situations in which legitimate transactions are misclassified as frauds, transfers are declined, and accounts are suspended) and false negatives (scenarios in which legitimate frauds are missed).</p>



<p>It&#8217;s crucial to note that as businesses look for ways to employ AI to gain a competitive advantage, they&#8217;re also facing obstacles. AI bias, government regulation of AI, managing the data needed for machine learning initiatives, and skill shortages are all issues to be concerned about.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if the necessary skills and infrastructure for AI are not in place, financial rewards may be elusive. It is important to consider these factors before investing in AI technology for the above-mentioned business benefits.</p>



<h2><strong>Where to Invest in AI</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Because of its rapid expansion, AI investment, or learning how to invest in the AI industry, is becoming increasingly popular. Some investors are getting more interested in stocks across multiple industries as AI becomes more integrated into different types of organizations and industries.</p>



<p>What makes AI investing so appealing is its potential for long-term profitability. It is a good idea to think about both qualitative and quantitative aspects before plunging into the world of AI investment. Even reputable, profitable firms can be a bad financial investment if share prices are too high for you.</p>



<p>Analyze performance and valuation indicators to better position yourself to buy AI stocks with high return potential. Some of the things to consider include:</p>



<ul><li>The company’s financial health</li><li>Price-to-earnings ratio</li><li>The level of risk involved</li><li>The dividend potential—how much the stock is likely to pay in dividends</li><li>The stock chart for gauging price movements</li></ul>



<p>To set yourself up for long-term success, your AI investment portfolio should be as varied and resilient as possible. The following are some of the areas where you can invest in AI.</p>



<h3><strong>ETFs</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Many prominent U.S. public firms are either currently utilizing AI or actively trying to invest in the technology, so most retail investors have already been exposed to it. However, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide an efficient and convenient alternative to invest in AI-specific stocks for individuals seeking a broader scope.</p>



<p>AI ETFs contain a portfolio of publicly traded firms active in all stages of AI, from research to application, similar to other specialized investing types such as genomics, cybersecurity, and blockchain technology. Some of the ETFs to consider include the following:</p>



<ul><li>ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO)</li><li>ARK Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics ETF (ARKQ)</li><li>Global X Robotics &amp; Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ)</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Stocks</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Investors wishing to invest in AI stocks have a variety of options. Today, many AI companies issue stocks for public buying. With so much growth in AI expected in the future, now is the best time for tech-savvy investors to get involved with AI stock investments.</p>



<p>How can investors who want to be among the first to invest in the next Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, or Amazon obtain exposure to AI in a way that allows them to profit in the long run without taking on too much risk?</p>



<p>Investors should adopt a long-term view rather than betting on one or two businesses they believe would be big winners in AI. &nbsp;It is also very important to have a diversified AI stock portfolio. Look for three things to unlock value when researching the market for AI winners:</p>



<ul><li>Rich data sets that aid in the development of algorithms and apps that improve people&#8217;s lives.</li><li>Large data centers with big servers, as well as scalable processing capacity</li><li>Talent in AI engineering to avoid brainpower constraints</li></ul>



<h3><strong>5 AI Companies Worth Investing In</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>Today, people and companies can profit directly from AI by investing in companies that sell the hardware, software, services, or knowledge of the technology. With this in mind, the following are some of the best AI companies to invest in today—both directly and through the purchase of stocks.</p>



<p><strong><u>Nvidia</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p>The AI boom has profited Nvidia, the world&#8217;s largest graphics chip company. Its graphics cards have become synonymous with data centres all around the world.</p>



<p>Nvidia&#8217;s data centre business model accounts for an ever-increasing portion of its total revenue. Nvidia&#8217;s graphics cards are utilized to help optimize a wide range of data centre uses, so it&#8217;s not all AI-related. However, artificial intelligence is one of the key drivers of the company&#8217;s expansion and growth.</p>



<p><strong><u>DocuSign</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p>Few investors would have guessed that acquiring signatures on a contract might be profitable. But DocuSign achieved just that, going from a $10 billion startup to a $50 billion giant with a stock price that has increased nearly sevenfold since its IPO in April 2018. (IPO).</p>



<p>And now, AI may be the catalyst for the company&#8217;s next phase of expansion. DocuSign&#8217;s acquisition of Seal Software, an AI firm, in 2020 implies the company can now support businesses and individuals not only in getting contracts signed but also in evaluating and monitoring contractual agreements.</p>



<p>Seal&#8217;s technology puts the &#8220;intelligent&#8221; in &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; by going beyond keyword searches and comparing crucial contract sections and terms side by side to uncover threats and opportunities. DocuSign is growing in practically every metric, which is a plus when it comes to investing in AI stocks.</p>



<p><strong><u>IBM</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p>IBM&#8217;s AI strategy aims to leverage the technology to enhance human intellect, increase efficiency, and reduce total costs.</p>



<p>For example, IBM&#8217;s AI technology is being utilised in the healthcare sector to create custom care plans, expedite the supply of new pharmaceuticals, and improve overall care quality. On the other hand, in the financial industry, IBM is utilising artificial intelligence to assist clients with financial regulatory compliance. So, investing in IBM’s AI development efforts can bring ROI from two different industries.</p>



<p><strong><u>Amazon</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p>Amazon may well be the organization that makes the most use of artificial intelligence. So, investing in its AI efforts may be a no-brainer. From AWS Sagemaker to Amazon Go grocery shops and Alexa, AI technology is the foundation of many of Amazon’s expansion efforts today. Investing in the cutting-edge AI technology of Amazon has the potential to yield massive returns.</p>



<p><strong><u>Achievion</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p>The last company to make the list is Achievion. Located in the heart of McLean, Virginia, Achievion Solutions delivers web and mobile solutions powered by AI to help companies of all sizes. The company was recently ranked by Clutch as Washington DC’s top AI company. Achievion delivers intelligent web and mobile solutions powered by AI to help companies get ahead of the competition. This alone is enough to encourage anyone to invest in the company.</p>



<h2><strong>Final Word</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>We hope this article serves as a good introduction to some of the principles and trends that illustrate why AI has so much promise in the investment sector. AI investing offers a variety of intriguing future possibilities, but investors should act with caution.</p>



<p>Before investing in AI, perform due diligence on the preferred AI investment to avoid losing money. When making investments in artificial intelligence (AI), proceed with caution will do your business and/or finances a world of good.</p>

<p>This post is the sixth entry in our series on AI application patterns across multiple industries. In this post, we will discuss how AI and machine learning can help find the optimal solution through iterations of trial and error.</p>



<h2>Understanding Reinforcement Learning: The Machine Learning Type Typically Associated With the Trial and Error Process</h2>



<p>When discussing AI application patterns, a key pattern of AI that cannot be missed are goal-driven systems. We describe this as the use of machine learning and other approaches to cognition to provide your agent (AI) with the opportunity to learn by trial and error.</p>



<p>This approach is specifically aimed at finding the best solution to a problem. Iterative problem solving, resource optimization, and scenario simulation are examples of this pattern. Reinforcement learning approaches to machine learning dominate some of the most popular examples and use cases of this pattern.</p>



<p>Reinforcement learning is the process of learning to map from conditions to behavior to optimize a scalar gain or a reinforcing alert. The learning system is not told what action to take, as with other ways of learning. Instead, it must figure out which actions produce the highest reward by attempting them.</p>



<p>For the most fascinating and difficult situations, actions influence not just the instant reward but also the scenario that follows, and all future incentives arising from that. The trial-and-error search and delayed incentive are the two defining characteristics of reinforcement learning. Let’s take a deeper look into reinforcement learning and how it enables goal-driven systems.</p>



<h3>The Reinforcement Learning Secrets</h3>



<p>Reinforcement learning is probably the hardest field of ML to grasp because you will find that there are so many things happening simultaneously or at the same time.</p>



<p>Chess is a prime example of how the RL algorithm works. The software knows the game rules and how to playand will go through the steps to finish the round. The only piece of information the program gets is whether it has won or lost the match. It continues playing the game until it eventually wins a match, all while keeping track of its positive moves. &nbsp;This was a non-technical way of explaining how reinforcement learning works. Let’s now take a look at a more technical explanation of RL.</p>



<h3>Markov Decision Process</h3>



<p>A cycle of trial and error, reinforcement learning involves the agent taking a series of actions in a setting. The agent has a state every single moment, and acts from that specific state to a new one. There may or may not be a reward for this particular behavior.</p>



<p>So, we can conclude that any epoch of learning (or an episode) can be interpreted as a series of states, acts, and incentives. Each state depends only on the preceding states and behavior and is essentially stochastic as the setting. The Markov property is satisfied by this process.</p>



<p>The Markov property implies that the conditional probability distribution of process states in the future is dependent only on the current state and not on the series of events that came before it. This entire process is called the Markov decision process.</p>



<h2>The Categories of Reinforcement Learning</h2>



<p>Today, there are many different types of reinforcement learning algorithms. Each RL algorithms focuses on something different. While there are many unique RL algorithms, model-based and model-free are the two main categories that reinforcement learning algorithms can be classified into. The following is a brief explanation of each category.</p>



<h3>1. Model-Based</h3>



<p>These algorithms are designed to learn from their observations how the world (its mechanics) functions, and then prepare a solution by utilizing that model. Once they have a blueprint, they use some form of preparation to find the best strategy. They are known to be efficient in data. However, they struggle when space is too big for the state. &nbsp;Examples of model-based approaches are dynamic programming methods. This is because they need maximum environmental awareness, such as probabilities of change and incentives.</p>



<h3>2. Model-Free</h3>



<p>Model-free algorithms do not need to study the environment and preserve all states and behavior combinations. They can be classified into the following two groups, depending upon the training&#8217;s ultimate objective.</p>



<h4>Policy-Based Methods</h4>



<p>They look to find the best strategy, be it deterministic or stochastic. In this group, you will find algorithms such as REINFORCE and policy gradients. The benefits of these algorithms are increased coordination and efficacy in high dimensional or dynamic spaces of operation.</p>



<p>Policy-based approaches are an issue of optimization, where we consider a policy function to its limit. This is why we also use algorithms such as Hill Climbing and Evolution Strategies (ESs).</p>



<h4>Value-Based Methods</h4>



<p>They look to determine the optimum value. A significant part of this group is an algorithm family called Q-learning, which learns to maximize the Q-value. Q-learning is an important part of Reinforcement learning. Other algorithms include Value Iteration and SARSA.</p>



<p>At the convergence of policy and value-based approaches, we have the Actor-Critical approaches, which seek to maximize both policy and value function.</p>



<h2>Understanding Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>



<p>Deep neural networks have been utilized to model environmental dynamics (mode-based), boost policy searches (policy-based), and estimate the value function (value-based). A model called Deep Q Network has resulted from research on the value function. This is a model credited for some of the most impressive developments in the field, along with its many upgrades (e.g. Atari).</p>



<p>Deep reinforcement learning incorporates artificial neural networks into a reinforcement learning system that allows software-defined agents to recognize the optimal behaviors in a simulated environment to achieve their objectives. That is to say it binds function estimation and optimization of targets, connecting pairs of state-action to anticipated incentives. &nbsp;Is this too complicated for you to understand? Here’s deep reinforcement learning explained in a more layman language.</p>



<p>Deep reinforcement learning is a subset of machine learning and AI where advanced systems can learn from their behaviors in a manner similar to how humans learn from experience. Intrinsic in this form of machine learning is the rewarding or penalizing of an agent based on their behaviors. Actions are rewarded (reinforced) if they get them to the desired result.</p>



<p>A machine continues to learn through a sequence of trials and errors, making this technology perfect for dynamic environments that change continuously. While reinforcement learning has existed for many years, it has been combined with deep learning only recently hand and this has produced remarkable results.</p>



<p>The &#8220;deep&#8221; part of reinforcement learning indicates several (deep) layers of artificial neural networks that mimic the design of a human brain. Deep learning demands a lot of computing resources and large volumes of training data. However, data volumes have grown exponentially in the past few years, while the cost of computing power has fallen significantly, allowing for the proliferation of deep learning applications.</p>



<p>After the highly-publicized loss of a Go grandmaster at the hands of <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaGo</a>, the prospects of deep reinforcement learning were brought to the attention of many. Deep reinforcement learning does not excel at playing Go, but it has also reached human-level mastery in other games as well. These games include Atari, poker, chess, and other video/online games.&nbsp; The applications of deep reinforcement learning are not limited to games. Their practical applications can be found in the following sectors as well.</p>



<h3>Training</h3>



<p>AI toolkits like Psychlab, DeepMind Lab, and OpenAI Gym provide the training environment required to propel large-scale development for in-depth reinforcement learning. Open source tools, they are designed to train DRL agents. We will continue to see rapid growth in practical implementations as more companies apply deep reinforcement learning to their own specific business use cases.</p>



<h3>Automotive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The automotive industry has a varied and extensive dataset that will allow deep learning to be strengthened. It will help optimize manufacturing, vehicle servicing and overall automation in industry; it is already in use for autonomous vehicles. The automotive industry is defined by reliability, cost and quality, and DRL can provide new opportunities to increase quality, save costs and ensure a better safety record using data from consumers, suppliers and warranties.</p>



<h3>Healthcare</h3>



<p>From diagnosis and assessing appropriate treatment plans to clinical trials, development of new drug, and automated treatment, there is tremendous potential for developing healthcare through deep reinforcement learning.</p>



<h3>Manufacturing</h3>



<p>Intelligent robots in warehouse and distribution centers are becoming increasingly common for sorting out millions of goods and distributing them to the right people. When a robot chooses a unit to place in a container, deep reinforcement learning allows it acquire knowledge based on whether it has succeeded or failed. The robot then uses this knowledge to perform better in the future.</p>



<p>A real-world example of this is BRETT, previously known Willow Garage Personal Robot 2 (PR2). BRETT is a <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2015/05/21/deep-learning-robot-masters-skills-via-trial-and-error/">robot developed by a team of researchers at UC Berkeley’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences worked with</a>.</p>



<p>The algorithm regulating the learning of the robot included a component of reward, which generated a score based on how well the robot was performing the job. &nbsp;Movements that took the robot closer to accomplishing the job will result in higher scores than those that do not. The score feeds back via the neural net in order to allow the robot to learn which moves are better for the job.</p>



<h3>Conversational Bots</h3>



<p>The conversational User interface framework that enables AI bots utilizes the power of deep reinforcement learning. Thanks to deep reinforcement learning, the bots are rapidly mastering the complexities and terminology of language in several domains for automated speech and natural language comprehension.</p>



<h2>3 Ways Machine Learning and Other Cognitive Approaches Are Helping Find the Optimal Solution through Iterations of Trial And Error</h2>



<p>The following are some of the main ways machine learning and other cognitive approaches are helping find the optimal solution through iterations of trial and error.</p>



<h3>1. Scenario Simulation</h3>



<p>A scenario simulation is an artificial illustration of a real-world occurrence by means of experiential learning to accomplish educational objectives. It takes careful preparation to develop a successful simulation scenario and it can be divided into several phases.</p>



<p>Simulation scenarios are developed to evaluate, inform and assist learners in finding differences in their comprehension of the content or information application. Simulation may also be used to address patient health concerns, clinical events, communication difficulties, organizational skills, the potential for teamwork, and leadership skills. A real-world example of scenario simulation is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/phishme-releases-free-phishing-training-tools-for-smbs/"> PhishMe</a>.</p>



<p>Hackers are constantly using spearphishing and phishing email attacks to target employees. To counter this danger, security firm PhishMe has built simulation software that can be used by a business executive, human resource, IT, and auditors to inform their employees.</p>



<p>PhishMe assists in generating and distributing focused phishing messages with hyperlinks, including those requesting username and password, or attachments intended to engage users. The platform then collects user response metrics in a centralized storage location for organizations to create reports or share them with users.</p>



<h3>2. Resource Optimization</h3>



<p>Resource optimization helps organizations to satisfy resource requests optimally. Resource optimization analyses all open resource requests against available resources and sets out a strategy that helps you to meet the objectives of the company.</p>



<p>The AI, resource optimization tool, utilizes a range of sophisticated AI techniques, like genetic algorithms, business rules, and constraint programming, to intelligently generate tailored resource allocation timelines and strategies that reliably fulfill goal requirements while fulfilling all rules and constraints. Using an advanced dynamic rescheduling algorithm, this AI tool also enables organizations to respond to unforeseen events or changes in workload demands.</p>



<h3>3. Iterative Problem Solving</h3>



<p>Iterative problem solving in AI and machine learning takes inspiration from the software-development lifecycle, which is essentially a process in which you are solving a problem—in well-defined steps. Like software development, problem-solving in machine learning and AI is an iterative process which includes the following steps:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Recognizing the Problem</li><li>Reviewing the Dataset</li><li>Establishing a Realistic End Goal</li><li>Listing Alternate Solutions</li><li>Selecting a Solution</li><li>Implementing the solutions</li><li>Evaluation</li></ol>



<p>By going through the above steps, machine learning algorithms can understand a problem and then solve it iteratively.</p>



<h2>Final Word</h2>



<p>Machines have mastered games of such as chess and checkers and quickly found answers to mazes in the past. Now, they can compete at Go, multi-player games like DoTA, and even more complex games, thanks to the power of reinforcement learning and other sophisticated computing capabilities.</p>



<p>For goal-driven systems, games are not the only area of application. Machine learning and other cognitive methods can be implemented by companies to leverage the power of reinforcement learning and other machine learning strategies to equip their applications with the ability to learn by trial and error. It is valuable in any situation where you want the application to find the best or optimal solution to a problem. COVID-19 vaccine development is a latest and greatest example of this process.</p>



<p>In the final article in this series, we will look at how a combination of Smart Workflow, RPA and other semantic automation methods can be used to simplify everyday routine tasks and free human resources for more creative tasks.</p>

<p>This post is the fifth entry in our series on AI application patterns across multiple industries. In this post, we will discuss how AI and machine learning are helping analyze massive amounts of data to find meaningful patterns and anomalies.</p>



<h2>Some Examples of Anomalies and the Importance of Anomaly Detection</h2>



<p>There is truth in the belief that the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) will someday transform the world. Until now, the proliferation of data is what has made the universe spin faster. However, big data piling up in often unmanageable data sets rendered the Creme de la creme into a challenge, forcing companies and organizations to make a quicker, real-time decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An approach for processing data more quickly and effectively is to identify unexpected events, updates or changes in datasets. Anomaly detection, a technology that depends on artificial intelligence (AI) to recognize irregular activity within the captured data set, has, therefore, become one of the Industrial IoT&#8217;s key objectives.</p>



<h3>Examples of Anomalies</h3>



<p>Anomaly detection involves detecting objects or occurrences that do not adhere to a pattern predicted or certain objects in a database that are typically impossible to detect by a human expert. Generally, these anomalies or irregularities may be converted into problems such as fraud, errors, and design defects. The following are examples of some potential anomalies that organizations may come across:</p>



<ul><li>Detecting fraud in money transactions</li><li>Several unsuccessful login attempts showing the potential for cyber-fishing</li><li>A leaky link pipe which results in the complete production line being shut down</li></ul>



<p>These are just a few of the hundreds of potential anomalies that make anomaly detection critical for organizations today. Let’s dig a little deeper into why detecting anomalies is critical for businesses today.</p>



<h3>Why Anomaly Detection is Critical for Businesses Today</h3>



<p>More and more organizations today are starting to realize the value of integrated processes to get a complete picture of their business. In addition, they have to respond quickly to constantly evolving data changes, particularly in the context of cyber-security risks. Anomaly detection may be the best way to tackle these breaches, as disruptions in normal activity, when detecting abnormalities, signify the existence of expected or unforeseen triggered interventions, errors, defects and so on.</p>



<p>Sadly, there is no efficient way to physically manage and evaluate ever-increasing datasets. With the adaptive environments having multiple components in incessant motion in which the &#8220;natural&#8221; behavior is continuously reframed, a new measured approach is required to recognize anomalous or unusual behavior.</p>



<p>In times where human resources are not adequate to manage the dynamic world of containers, microservices, and cloud computing, AI comes in and provides assistance in several ways to help with anomaly detection. These ways or the anomaly detection tasks for AI/machine learning are discussed later in this article.</p>



<h2>Categories of Anomaly</h2>



<p>Detection of anomalies involves a technique that detects unusual occurrences or phenomena that can raise suspicions by being objectively distinct from the rest of the phenomena. This &#8220;anomalous&#8221; activity usually converts into a problem such as cyber-attack, server of failure, credit-card fraud, etc. An anomaly can essentially be divided into the following three groups or categories.</p>



<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Point Anomaly</h3>



<p>A tuple is considered to be a point anomaly if it is far from the other data in the same database. In simple words, point anomaly is where just one instance of data is anomalous as a result of being extremely far from the rest. An example of point anomaly is credit card fraud detection based on ‘money that is spent’.</p>



<h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contextual Anomaly</h3>



<p>An occurrence is a contextual anomaly if it is a phenomenon attributable to the observation background. The anomaly is specific to context. In time-series data, this sort of anomaly is normal. Real-world example: It is common to spend a hundred dollars per day on food during the holiday period, but otherwise it may be unusual.</p>



<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collective Anomaly</h3>



<p>A series of occurrences of data help locate an anomaly. This is referred to as a collective anomaly. Real-world example of this would be a person suddenly attempting to import data from a remote computer to a local host, a phenomenon which would be flagged as a possible cyber-attack.</p>



<p>Identification of anomalies is comparable to — but not quite the same as — removal of noise and identification of novelties. For instance, novelty detection is associated with detecting a non-observed trend in new findings that are not part of the training data — like, for example, an immediate fascination in a new YouTube channel around the holiday period.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Noise reduction (NR) is the method of inoculating data from the emergence of unintended inferences; in other words, the elimination of noise from a signal otherwise important. It was important to make this distinction because a lot of people use anomaly detection, novelty detection, and noise removal interchangeably, as if they are the same thing, which is not the case.</p>



<h2>How Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection Works</h2>



<p>In data mining, the discovery of objects or occurrences that do not adhere to an anticipated trend or to other items found in a database is referred to anomaly detection. Such anomalous objects usually can be converted into issues of some kind, such as frauds, errors, and structural flaws.&nbsp; The use of machine learning for identification of anomalies can help to increase the detection speed.</p>



<p>Anomalies are those actions that can harm the information networks. Detection of these intruders has gained widespread interest in recent years. Anomaly detection may be a key to solving breaches, because when identifying abnormalities, common behavioral disruptions suggest an existence of deliberate or unintentional errors, flaws, triggered attacks etc.</p>



<p>The implementation of machine learning algorithms can provide an easy but efficient approach to identifying and categorizing these anomalies for businesses. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are capable of learning from data and of predicting based on that data. &nbsp;ML for identification of anomalies uses techniques that provide a viable approach to detecting and classifying anomalies based on an initial broad feature set. The following are two machine learning techniques for the effective identification of anomalies.</p>



<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervised Anomaly Detection</h3>



<p>To generate a predictive model to identify potential data points, this approach includes a classified database comprising normal as well as anomalous samples. K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Help Vector Machine Learning, Neural Networks are the most widely used algorithms for this.</p>



<p>K-nearest neighbor (k-NN) is among the most common nonparametric methods used for the identification of anomalies in supervised learning. It measures the estimated intervals on the input variables between various points and then attributes the unmarked point to its K-nearest neighbors class. The Bayesian network is another common model, capable of encoding stochastic relationships between interest variables. This method is commonly used in conjunction with statistical methods for the identification of anomalies.</p>



<h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</h3>



<p>This approach involves no training data and considers two things about the data instead, i.e. just a tiny fraction of data is anomalous and every deviation is objectively different from the usual observations. The data is then grouped using a correlation measure based on the above premises, and the data points which are far away from the group are deemed anomalies.</p>



<p>Premised on these two principles, data groups of identical occurrences that frequently occur are believed to be regular traffic, and those data groups that are uncommon are deemed hostile. The most popular unsupervised algorithms are single-class support vector machine, self-organizing maps (SOM), adaptive resonance theory (ART), K-means, meta-algorithm (EM) expectation-maximization, C-means. The Self-organizing Map (SOM) is a commonly used technique. The main goal of this technique is to lower the visualization aspect of the results.</p>



<h2>The Anomaly Detection Tasks for AI/Machine Learning</h2>



<p>There are several things, when a person drives, that are easily noticed and then overlooked. Those issues that may be a threat are what attract attention. &nbsp;Special attention needs to be paid to an approaching car driving into the same lane, a light turning yellow, a pedestrian who could go out on the road, and so on. They&#8217;re exceptions, the out of ordinary things. The same holds in the business computing world. A sudden rise in revenue, for example, is fantastic, but the business needs to trace the anomalous rise back to its source to ascertain and reproduce the cause.</p>



<p>The rise of social media, mobile devices, cloud computing, and e-commerce has caused an abundance of data accessible to businesses as well as an increase in business threats. Cyber-attacks are one of the most noticeable threats. There&#8217;s a massive amount of transactions hitting the firewall and servers of an organization each day.</p>



<p>Although there may be a threat only to some transactions, those threats may risk millions of dollars in revenue. The large transaction volume makes it difficult for an individual to monitor and act promptly on marked anomalies. &nbsp;However, anomalous details must be identified fast to take effective steps for both risks and rewards accurately and fast. Here is where it can be useful to leverage AI and its kin, machine learning (ML). &nbsp;The following are the ways AI and ML can help organizations in detecting anomalies.</p>



<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Automation</h3>



<p>Anomaly detection algorithms driven by AI can examine the datasets automatically, seamlessly adjust the typical behavior variables and detect pattern breaches.</p>



<h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Real-Time Analysis</h3>



<p>AI applications will analyze the behavior of the data in real time. The instant the machine doesn&#8217;t understand a pattern, it sends out a signal.</p>



<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-Learning</h3>



<p>AI-driven algorithms are the foundation of self-learning systems which can learn from patterns of data and provide forecasts or answers as needed.</p>



<h3>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy</h3>



<p>AI improves anomaly detection accuracy to prevent disruptive warnings and false positives / negatives caused by fixed limits.</p>



<h3>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Risk Analysis</h3>



<p>Detection of anomalies is all about identifying interest trends (deviations, idiosyncrasies, outliers etc.) that diverge from anticipated activity within dataset(s). Like in most data science ventures, an algorithm or operational model is not the ultimate objective or anomaly detection output. It’s all about the perspective outliers give, instead. For a company, that is, saving money from avoiding loss of revenue due to fraudulent transactions, by avoiding damage to assets, etc.</p>



<h3>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scrupulousness/Intelligent Monitoring</h3>



<p>&nbsp;Anomaly detection systems include end-to-end disparity-free tracking to scrutinize data and locate the slightest anomalies that human beings would not find.</p>



<h3>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fraud Detection</h3>



<p>The seventh and final anomaly detection task for AI/machine learning on our list is fraud detection. There are three reasons why emphasizing AI for risk reduction makes sense. Firstly, it is expensive to fail to identify fraud and laundering of money. In the year 2019, authorities in the US and UK issued fines amounting to <a href="https://www.internationalinvestment.net/news/4009055/money-laundering-fines-total-usd-14bn-2019">$8.14 billion</a> for breaches of money laundering.</p>



<p>Secondly, effective risk management systems bring customers at ease and boost the company’s credibility. For instance, customers are more inclined to use companies with a track record of stopping cyber-attacks.</p>



<p>Thirdly, by using AI to automate cyber -security practices, fraud detection, and certain enforcement, companies can realize substantial savings in time and money. This needs considerable efforts from humans today, and existing anomaly detection systems based on rules leave much to yearn for.</p>



<h2>Final World</h2>



<p>Machine learning techniques are now attracting significant attention from researchers in the field of anomaly detection to overcome the shortcomings of information-based techniques.&nbsp; Detection of anomalies will help to identify fraud efficiently and uncover suspicious behavior in large and complicated Big Data sets.</p>



<p>It can be valuable in areas that are vulnerable to subversive activities such as marketing, medicine, natural sciences, and banking security.&nbsp; Additionally, a learning organization may use the computer to enhance search and grow the efficacy of its digital enterprise efforts. In the next article in this series, we will look at how AI and machine learning can help find the optimal solution through iterations of trial and error.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This post is the fourth entry in our
series on AI application patterns across multiple industries. </p>



<p>In this post, we will discuss how AI and machine learning is
used to develop a unique profile of each individual that is then used to
customize and personalize the user experience.</p>



<h2>What is AI-Driven Personalization?</h2>



<p>It is critical for businesses to understand the needs of
their customers/users. Additionally, they need to move away from a
one-size-fits-all approach onto a user experience that is more personalized;
this will help to yield better results.</p>



<p>However, several challenges need to be overcome to make this
transition; the most significant of these challenges is the time and effort
required to make the shift to a more personalized user experience. A lot needs
to be done by the businesses wanting to make the move including mapping out
individual journeys, developing marketing-driven personas, identifying the key
moments, and then working around those factors.</p>



<p>When it comes to truly understanding the individual users
and their needs, marketing-driven personas can often be flawed. This means that
the traditional way of personalizing the user experience or customer journey
wouldn’t get you far. The only way that can truly bridge the gap is by using
artificial intelligence (AI). Following are two ways AI is aiding the personalization
process.</p>



<h3>1. Advancement of Narrow AI</h3>



<p>We’ve had AI for almost three decades now. However, advances
in AI in the past decade or so have helped to develop cognitive systems with
the ability to learn, understand, reason, and interact. For businesses looking
to enhance their marketing efforts or the customer journey, a relevant area is
the advancement of “narrow AI”. </p>



<p>What is narrow AI? It is the application of the general
algorithms and concepts of AI to particular, closely-defined problem areas for optimal-value
results. In recent years, there has been rapid progress in narrow AI. There was
a need to understand and then code the algorithms only a decade ago. However,
this changed about five years ago when AI and ML algorithms started to be
commodified and moved to the cloud.</p>



<p>What was the benefit of this? it has allowed companies to
drive real business value from the technology. Image recognition is a common
application area of narrow AI. It allows mapping an image’s key physical points
against a ‘learning network’ that provides the possible meaning of those
points. </p>



<p>This can be used in digital marketing for automatically
tagging images in a digital asset management (DAM) software. Another key use in
digital marketing is optimization. Narrow AI can help to optimize conversion by
allowing you to determine pricing, targeted offers, promotions etc.</p>



<p>Having far greater value that simply giving customers a
‘good offer’, personalizing the user experience/customer journey to understand
the user and predict their needs can help create loyal customers.</p>



<p>This is because personalizing the user experience/customer journey with AI allows businesses to create meaningful connections that increase engagements and are based on much more than just a ‘good offer’. Using marketing-driven personas to create great user experiences and customer journeys can be effective. However, they alone are often not enough. Persona recognition may be needed too.</p>



<h3>2. Persona Recognition</h3>



<p>Image recognition generates a match through the use of key physical
characteristics. On the other hand, persona recognition uses key behavioral
characteristics to do the same. Persona recognition begins with the use of AI
to perform data analysis and discover behavioral affinities’ clusters. These
are the correlations among users that show similar patterns of interactions and
decision making.</p>



<p>Ultimately, these patterns are converted into insight-driven
personas that can be used for targeted activities in the next stage of the
process; this is the stage where it is possible to observe and match users in
real time against the personas that are inferred.</p>



<p>The final stage of persona recognition involves the use of
AI, based on experimentation and observation, to come up with content, paths,
and other user experience parts that AI finds to be the best for each persona.
This could either be driven completely by AI or it could be experimentation
controlled by humans.</p>



<h2>How AI is Helping Transform the
Digital Experience Through Personalized Intelligence</h2>



<p>Creating and delivering personalized content and user
experiences not only makes users/customers feel that they are understood, but
it also makes them feel valued. This can be immensely powerful in creating
loyal customers. Therefore, personalizing content and user experiences is
invaluable and you can do that at scale with AI technology. Following are some
ways AI is helping transform the digital experience through personalized

with personalization</a>. This is a cause of concern since customers today are
increasingly wanting experiences with brands that are unique and personalized.
Customers want to build deeper connections with the businesses they patronize,
and marketers must take a serious note of this.</p>



<p>The good news is that AI-powered solutions make it easier to
develop content marketing strategies that align with the unique needs of an
individual customer. They do this by automating the type of content, the
communication channels, and even the timing of content delivery. Additionally,
AI enables marketers to create customized customer experiences by allowing them
to perform in-depth analysis of various data patterns. This is known as
predictive personalization.</p>



<p>In predictive personalization, the available data is
analyzed and tools for customer profiling are used to automatically optimize
conversions by adapting content in real-time. Powered by ML algorithms, this
enables a high level of personalization.</p>



<p>An example of this would be the use of customer data, such

activity, by a travel company to come up with locations and type of activities
that are likely to appeal each customer and then customizing marketing messages
based on this.</p>

can create smarter and more personalized digital ads and campaigns by using the
data made available by the AI technology. Algorithms and big data are used by
AI and ML to create better insights for your marketing team; they study social
media profiles, keyword queries, and other relevant data online to come up with
these insights.</p>

company, achieving ad efficiency is critical. Luckily, achieving this
efficiency has become easier thanks to AI/ML- based platforms such as Google

instead of targeting ads to users that have a 50/50 chance of converting.

help to optimize your cost per click. Here, ML tools can be used to analyze the
performance of ads, get recommendations, and make any alternations that are
needed. Ultimately, this helps to reduce/optimize your cost per click of Google
Ads.</p>

sending out an automated message or mail that addresses a customer by name. To
personalize customer service, you not only need to capture the attention of the
customer, but you also need to an create authentic engagement that is relevant
at every stage of the customer journey.</p>



<p>A lack of trust and personalization has resulted in over <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/us-consumers-turn-off-personal-data-tap-as-companies-struggle-to-deliver-the-experiences-they-crave-accenture-study-finds.htm">40

competitor. The implementation of innovative approaches that deeply resonate
with customers is needed by organizations to create a truly personalized
customer experience; this is a user experience that leaves customers feeling
appreciated and value.</p>

years have enabled AI-solutions, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, to
learn how to provide customer service, including learning the ways to respond
to and engaged with customers. But, can these solutions help deliver
personalized customer experiences? Yes, they can. </p>



<p>You can use AI to harness large volumes of data from
multiple sources and find patterns in customer behavior that allows you to
perform mass personalization. In order to create a specific profile of each
customer, AI utilizes the customer’s interaction history. This helps it to find
patterns in customer behavior which in turn allows the delivery of highly
personalized experiences to increase customer engagement and improve customer experience.</p>

shopping on a website that makes <a href="http://www.intelliverse.com/blog/the-power-of-personalized-product-recommendations">personalized
recommendations</a>. Products tailored to the preferences of individual
customers can be offered on websites using recommendation engines. A real-world
example of this is Amazon’s recommendation engine that helps to generate <a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/customer-experience-2/recommendation-engines-how-amazon-and-netflix-are-winning-the-personalization-battle/">35%</a>
of all of the company’s sales.</p>



<p>A system that filters information about users, an AI
recommendation engine can make suggestions to users based on the preferences,
interests, and past behavior. Based on this customer profile, the specific
interests/ preferred items of a specific user can be predicted. </p>



<p>Recommendations systems make the customer journey and user
experience seamless by allowing customers to find the items they want easily
and quickly. &nbsp;On the other hand,
